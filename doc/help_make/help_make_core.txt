==============================================================================
Typing `make` in the src directory (~abinit/src) leads to the compilation of
all abinit sources, either standard, or following specific indications
of a config file, see ~abinit/doc/build/config-template.ac for details.
Usually, `make` should be prepared by running the "configure" script 
from the top directory while developers can generate it by running
 `./config/scripts/makemake`.

In addition, `make` can be issued with the name of a main program like 
abinit, anaddb, cut3d, ...). In this case, the selected set of routines 
and/or the main code will be (re)compiled.

Specific keywords for the ~abinit/src `make`

parents        update parent and children list in each *.F90 routine
abirules       enforce ABINIT style in each *.F90 routines (not all yet)
abiauty        enforce correct indentation (+...) in each *.F90 routine (all)
clean          clean all the compiled objects and executables inside src
