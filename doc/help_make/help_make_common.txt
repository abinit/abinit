Typing `make` in the src directory (~abinit/shared/common/src) leads to the
compilation of abinit low-level sources, either standard, or following
specific indications of a config file, see ~abinit/doc/build/config-template.ac
for details. Usually, `make` should be prepared by running the "configure"
script from the top directory and developers can generate it by running
`./config/scripts/makemake` from there.
