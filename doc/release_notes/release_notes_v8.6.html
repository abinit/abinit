B.  Most noticeable achievements

B.1 The whole ABINIT documentation has been significantly upgraded by the introduction of "Topics", replacing the
    previous "lists of ABINIT features". All the capabilities of ABINIT are now presented in about 70 short topic Web pages.
    Those topic web pages usually have :
    - a brief introduction;
    - the list of related tutorial lessons -if any-; 
    - the list of related input variables (ordered according to their importance for the topics -compulsory, basic, useful or expert-);
    - possibly example input files;
    - list of references. 
    Entry point : see the new header of any ABINIT documentation file (e.g. the new user's guide)
    By F. Jollet and X. Gonze (also tests/fixes by B. Amadon, M. Torrent). 

B.2 A central bibliography database abiref.bib has been created, and linked to the
    above-mentioned topics (B.1) but also to other parts of the ABINIT documentation (e.g. input variable list,
    the lessons of the tutorial, the theory documents, the acknowledgments ...).
    More than 200 bibliographical references are present. 
    By X. Gonze and F. Jollet
 
B.3 The list of input variables has been restructured, and is now searchable.
    The input variables for anaddb, aim and optic have been included in the database.
    By J. Bieder, X. Gonze and F. Jollet

B.4 The frequency of usage of each input variable (in the set of automatic tests) is now automatically 
    computed, and mentioned in the documentation for this input variable. Examples input files are also mentioned in the documentation.
    The input files for the automatic tests can now be directly accessed on the Web, as well as the reference files for the lessons of the tutorial.
    By. X. Gonze and F. Jollet

B.5 Several important developments related to electron-phonon matrix element computation have been made. 
    The Frolich interpolation procedure for electron-phonon matrix elements, as explained in PRL 115, 176401 (2015), has been implemented. 
    The long-range part of the phonon coupling potential is modeled with the Born effective charges and the dielectric tensor. 
    This long-range part is substracted from the potential before the Fourier interpolation then added after the interpolation. 
    The resulting potential is in much better agreement with the full calculation, as can be verified from the el-ph matrix elements.
    A functionality has been added in the eph driver (eph_task=5) to only interpolate the phonon potential onto a fine q-point grid.
    The interpolation is performed one perturbation at a time, and is thus more memory efficient than the previous procedures.
    There is additional testing of the new "driver" optdrive=7 specifically dealing with electron-phonon
    related computations (including zero-point renormalisation), especially the interpolation.
    The symmetries have been fixed.
    See new tests v8#61-65.
    By  G. Antonius and M. Giantomassi.

B.6 ABINIT can now read pseudopotentials in the PSML format. This XML-based format is
    produced by ONCVPSP as well as ATOM (also read by SIESTA).
    See the new directory ~abinit/tests/psml, tests #1 to 14.
    By Y. Pouillon, M. Verstraete and J. Junquera

B.7 ABINIT is now interfaced with Libxc 3.0. The interface with Libxc 4.0 is in preparation.
    Tests libxc#06,07,17,18,20, 21 have been modified, because some functionals of libxc v2.0 have changed category in v3.0.
    By M. Torrent

B.8 A new lesson of the tutorial, called "Electron-positron annihilation" has been created.
    By J. Wiktor and M. Torrent.

B.9 The new input variable chkdilatmx has been introduced, to allow expert users to make
    ABINIT bypass the stopping criterion related to dilatmx. In practice, if the condition related 
    to dilatmx is not met, ABINIT continues, and delivers an (approximate) optimized geometry and energy,
    that might be used by external drivers like e.g. USPEX to continue the search for global optimized structures.
    See input variable chkdilatmx, and test v3#42 .
    By X. Gonze

B.10 Implementation of the LDA-1/2 methodology.
     (Input variable ? Test ?)
     By F. Jollet
    
__________________________________________________________________

C. Changes for the developers (also compilers)

C.1 Large changes of the procedure to document ABINIT, for most of the documentation files.
    The HTML files are now produced from YAML files, under the control of the script ~abinit/doc/generate_doc.py .
    The documentation on this procedure is available on the ABINIT wiki, at https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=developers:generate_doc . 
    This is directly linked to the modifications in the doc, presented in B1-B4.
    In particular, the Dokuwiki syntax is used for the hyperlinks.
    By F. Jollet and X. Gonze

__________________________________________________________________

D.  Other changes
(or on-going developments, not yet finalized).

D.1 The "Adaptively Compressed Operator" approach for the fast application of the Fock operator has been implemented,
    and replaces the traditional way to apply the Fock operator in hybrid functionals (e.g. HSE06, PBE0, ...).
    These are not yet to be considered in production, though (see D.4). Likely for ABINITv8.8.  
    See tests libxc 51, 52, 53, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, and also v7#65, 66, 70.
    By F. Jollet and X. Gonze

D.2 A set of 6 input files and accompanying references (from 32 to 2048 procs), for benchmarking high-performance computing
    is available in the new directory ~abinit/tests/hpc .
    Not yet tested automatically, but this future capability is prepared.
    By M. Torrent.

D.3 The tutorial on the temperature-dependent electronic structure has been imported from the ABINIT wiki to the
    usual location ~abinit/doc/tutorial . However, it is not yet operational.
    Work is also going on on tutorial fold2bloch.
    By X. Gonze

D.4 Interfacing with TRIQS 1.4 (instead of 1.3).
    By O. Gingras, B. Amadon and J.-M. Beuken

D.5 Anaddb can now interpolate and print out the DDB onto an arbitrary set of q-point.
    The same procedure was used to produce the phonon band structure.
    Now, with the input variable prtddb, anaddb will produce both the _DDB file and the _DDB.nc files, the latter being separated for each q-point.
    By G. Antonius

D.6 On-going work on hybrid functionals : speed-up of the SCF loop, computation of stresses, 
    joint computation of forces and stresses, downsampling the wavevectors. 
    By X. Gonze and F. Jollet

D.7 On-going work on the implementation of the TDEP algorithm (temperature dependent sampling).
    By J. Bieder, F. Bottin and Y. Bouchet
