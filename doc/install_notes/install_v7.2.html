<h1>Installation notes for ABINIT v7.2</h1>

<p>

This file provides a description of the operations needed to install
the ABINIT package, to generate the executable and to make the
tests. It provides also the description of simple modifications of the
package, for developers.</p>

<p>See a recent version of the
<a href="../users/new_user_guide.html">new user's guide</a>, for an
introduction to the abinit package. See a recent version of the
<a href="../users/abinit_help.html">abinit help</a> file
for learning how to use the code. Both of them can be
found in the Infos subdirectory.</p>

<p>Any comment or suggestion to improve the procedure will be
welcome! Simply contact the ABINIT group (http://forum.abinit.org/).

<h2><a name="short"></a>0. Short how to ...</h2>

<p>For the vast majority of people willing to use ABINIT (Unix/Linux,
not developers, but users), here follows a short list of instructions
needed to install it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download, gunzip and untar the latest version of ABINIT from the
  abinit Web site, then change directory to the top of the directory
  that was created. If you do not know what this means, go to
  <a href="#get_version"><strong>1. How to get a version of ABINIT?</strong></a>
  </li>
  <li>configure or ./configure  (or first create a tmp directory, then cd tmp, then ../configure)</li>
  <li>make (or "make multi" for using several processors on a SMP machine)</li>
  <li>(optionally) "make install"</li> 
</ol>
<p>
Well, it might also be that information on the Fortran compiler is
needed, in which case something like:
</p>
<pre> ./configure FC=your_F90_compiler </pre>
<p>instead of the bare "configure", might work, where
"your_F90_compiler" has to be replaced by the location of your F90
compiler, such as /usr/local/gcc432/bin/gfortran.
</p>
<br />
<p>
If you succeeded to download, gunzip and untar the ABINIT package, but
failed with the next steps, please go to
<a href="#make_executable"><strong>2. How to make the executables?</strong></a>.
</p>
<br />
<p>If you succeeded to make the executables, but would like to check
whether ABINIT has been installed correctly, please go to
<a href="#make_internal_tests"><strong>3. How to make the internal
tests?</strong></a> and the following sections.
</p>
<br />
<p>
If you want to have a much better handling on ABINIT than normal users,
or if on the contrary you simply want to download pre-compiled
executable (no compilation), or want to use Windows, then go to <a
href="#get_version"><strong>1. How to get a version of ABINIT?</strong></a>.
</p>
<br />
<p>
To build the executables you will need at least 400 Mb of free disk space.
Running all tests will require more than 2.5 Gb.
</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="get_version"></a>1. How to get a version of ABINIT?</h2>

<p>We will distinguish three cases:</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="#get_full_handle">1.A.</a> You have a F90 compiler under
   UNIX/Linux or MacOS X, as well as (free) software like bazaar,
   automake, autoconf, libtool, perl, python, and you want to have a
   full handle on the package (compilation, modification of files,
   writing of scripts ... this is the preferred case for developers). We
   will sometimes refer to this case as the "autotools working
   mode".</li>

   <li><a href="#get_basic_compile">1.B.</a> You have a F90 compiler
   under UNIX/Linux or MacOS X and you want simply to <strong>compile the
   source code</strong>, and, from time to time, <strong>modify and/or add a new
   file</strong> (this is the case of most users, system managers, and also
   many developers). We will sometimes refer to this case as being
   "without autotools".</li>

   <li><a href="#get_etsf">1.C.</a> You want to <strong>run ABINIT under
   Windows</strong> or <strong>run static binaries</strong>, or <strong>get UBUNTU,
   OpenSuse, FEDORA, OSX packages.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You should read only the appropriate section (you can safely ignore
the others ...).</p>

<h3><a name="get_full_handle"></a>1.A. To get a full handle of ABINIT</h3>

<p>
You have a F90 compiler under UNIX/Linux or MacOS X, as well as (free)
software like bazaar, automake, autoconf, libtool, perl, python, and you
want to have a full handle on the package (compilation, modification of
files, writing of scripts). This is the preferred case for developers...
We will sometimes refer to this case as the "autotools development
mode".
</p>

<p>
If you do not have these tools, and would like to have them, please
consult your local computer guru, and the following pages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://dev.abinit.org/doc/for-new-developers/how-to-contribute">An overview of ABINIT development</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dev.abinit.org/doc/for-new-developers/abinit-5-in-10-steps">10 steps to hike ABINIT</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dev.abinit.org/environment">ABINIT environment</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to develop, please have a bazaar branch (public + private)
created for you by contacting Yann Pouillon or Jean-Michel Beuken, as
described in these pages.
</p>

<p>
It is strongly advised to subscribe to the
<a href="http://forum.abinit.org/">ABINIT forum </a> if you want to be
able to get the latest information concerning the autotools development
mode.
</p>

<p>
After having installed Bazaar, and obtained a branch on the ABINIT
worldwide repository, create an automomous copy of the source code, on
top of which you have to make your development:
</p>
<pre>bzr branch bzr+ssh://forge.abinit.org/abinit/(developer)/(branch)</pre>
<p>
As an example, for the development of version 7.0 for the user 'hacker',
issue:
</p>
<pre>bzr branch bzr+ssh://forge.abinit.org/abinit/hacker/7.0.4-private</pre>
<br />
<p>
For your branches (public + private) on the ABINIT worldwide repository,
you will have the permission not only to download, but also to commit (push)
your modifications. You might alternatively download other branches of
the archives, but you will not be able to commit in these branches. So,
do not start to modify these, you will not be able to include them
afterwards in the archive.
</p>

<p>
Working with <tt>bzr branch</tt> creates a local archive for your daily work,
this archive being linked to the main ABINIT archive. This very
efficient technique is recommended, as it makes you more independent for
the management of your work (you will be able to create new branches).
One big advantage of this technique is that people working with a laptop
can develop and commit safely without a network connection.
</p>

<p>
Now, issue:
</p>
<pre>
./config/scripts/makemake
</pre>
<p>
or the shorter:
</p>
<pre>
*/*/makemake
</pre>
<p>
This command initializes a whole set of files and scripts, needed for
the autotools, as well as for the global work on ABINIT sources. This
initialization might take up to two minutes on old computers.
</p>

<p>
After this initialisation, you can proceed to the generation of the
executables, as described in <a href="#make_executable">section 2</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="get_basic_compile"></a>1.B. To get the sources and compile them</h3>

<p>
You have a F90 compiler under UNIX/Linux or MacOS X and you want simply
to <strong>compile the source files</strong>, and, from time to time, <strong>modify
and/or add a new file</strong>. This is the case of most users, system
managers, and also many developers. If you want to modify and/or add a
new file, please consult the section <a href="#modify">7. For developers
: how to modify the code?</a> after reading the present section.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, <i>x.x.x</i> represents the ABINIT version.
</p>

<p>
Now:
</p>
<pre>
download, gunzip and untar the file <strong>abinit-<i>x.x.x</i>.tar.gz</strong>
</pre>

<p>More detailed explanations ...</p>

<p>The <strong>abinit-<i>x.x.x</i>.tar.gz</strong> gzipped tar file contains all
the needed files, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the sources of the ABINIT code (also, the files needed for
  generating the Blas and Lapack libraries), in the directories "src"
  and "lib";</li>
  <li>the documentation, in the directory "doc";</li>
  <li>the complete set of tests, and the pseudopotentials needed for the tests, in the directory "tests";</li>
  <li>all the scripts and information needed to produce makefiles, in
  other directories, especially "config".</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>
It does NOT contain the object files and the binary executable files.
</p>

<p>So, execute the following actions:</p>

<pre><ul><li>Under Mac OS X, open a terminal session, so you can work as if it were a Unix platform.</li><li>Transfer the above-mentioned file(s) to your machine, in a directory suitable for the installation of the present version of ABINIT, and subsequent ones.<br />You should have about 250 MB of disk space to install the code, maybe more, depending on the version, and the number of tests that you will do.</li><li> gunzip (on some machine you need gzip -d) and untar the file '<strong>abinit-<i>x.x.x</i>.tar.gz</strong>':<br /> gunzip <strong>abinit-<i>x.x.x</i>.tar.gz</strong> | tar -xvf - </li></pre>

<p>
If correctly done, a main directory, denoted ~abinit in the present
document (usually, its real name will be <strong>abinit-<i>x.x.x</i></strong>) and
a whole set of subdirectories should have been created. One of them is
called 'doc/'. It contains many important informations.  Many of the
files it contains are .html files, that are placed on the Web site.
However, many other files are not available in .html format, and are NOT
found on the Web site.  In the future, keep in mind that the
information that you are looking for (but that you cannot find on the
Web site) might be in the subdirectories of doc/, esp. doc/theory/,
doc/users/, doc/psp_infos/.
</p>

<p>
You might now go to the <a href="#make_executable">section 2</a>.
</p>

<p>
Do not forget: if you want to modify and/or add a new file, please consult the section <a href="#modify">7. For developers: how to modify the code?</a> after reading the present section.

<h3><a name="get_etsf"></a>1.C. You want to <strong>run ABINIT under Windows</strong> or <strong>run static binaries</strong>, or <strong>get ubuntu, openSUSE, CentOS, fedora, OSX packages.</strong></h3>

<p>
Please access the 
<a href="http://www.etsf.eu/resources/software/etsf_software_repository">etsf software repository</a>. 
In case of problem, consult the <a href="http://forum.abinit.org">ABINIT_FORUM</a>.
</p>

<p>
You might now go to the <a href="#make_internal_tests">internal testing section</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="make_executable"></a>2. How to make the executables?</h2>

<p>If you got the binary executable package, you should skip the present section and go to the
<a href="#make_internal_tests">internal testing section</a>.
[These executables are presently stored in the ~abinit/opt subdirectory].
</p>

<p>
We now suppose that you have a F90 compiler and you want to compile the
source files.
</p>

<p>
In most cases, you will have to provide to the 'make' utility some information: the location
of the F90 compiler (and sometimes even the C compiler) on your machine,
the adequate compiler options, and, if you want to produce the parallel
binaries, the location of the MPI library on your machine.
</p>

<p>
Although the presently implemented building tools should be powerful
enough to succeed to make the binaries without you giving such information,
it has been seen that on a significant number of platforms, it was better still to give them.
</p>

<p>
Supposing that you are in the lucky case where the build system is able
to find all the information, then the build of ABINIT is very simple.
Issue:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>configure or ./configure  (or first create a tmp directory, then cd tmp, then ../configure)</li>
  <li>make or make  (or make multi for using several processors on a SMP machine)</li>
  <li>(optionally) make install</li>
</ul>
<p>
Well, it might also be that only one additional information is needed,
in which case something like:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>configure FC=f95</li>
 <li>make </li>
</ul>
<p>
might work. In both cases, let's explain a bit what is done, and the further possibilities.
</p>

<p>
The 'configure' step produces the set of Makefile files (among other
things), taking into account information about your machine and the
hostname.ac file. It takes one minute long, or less.  The 'make' step
compiles everything, according to the Makefile files produced in the
prior step. The time to make everything is highly dependent on the
compiler and platform.  On a 2.8 GHz quad-proc machine (using make mj4),
the whole compilation is about 5 minutes.  On some other platforms, with
only one processor, it might be more than one hour.
</p>

<p>
The executables will be located in the subdirectory ~abinit/src/98_main,
if you have chosen to issue ./configure in the ~abinit directory. If you
have issued ./configure in another directory, it will be placed accordingly.
</p>

<p>
The 'make' command can also be used in many different ways, by
mentioning one or more targets. A (partial) list of targets for users
can be obtained by typing:
</p>

<pre>make help</pre>
<p>
Additional targets, for developers, can be obtained by typing:
</p>
<pre>make help_dev</pre>

<p>
It is possible to compile only one of the executable,
just after the configure step by typing:
</p>
<pre>make name_of_the_binary (where name_of_the_binary can be abinit, cut3d, anaddb, ...)</pre>

<p>
These are only a tiny fraction of the things that you can realize thanks
to 'make'.  Moreover, there are also 'Makefile' files in most of the
subdirectories of ABINIT, with often their own (partial) list of targets
for users (and also sometimes for developers).  To obtain these lists,
go to the directory, and type:
</p>

<pre>make help</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>make help_dev</pre>
<p>Finally,</p>
<pre>make install</pre>

<p>
will install abinit in the /usr/local directory. In the directory
~abinit/doc/config/, you will find two important help files,
</p>

<p>
in case you want to go further,please consult:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>~abinit/doc/build/build-howto.txt;</li>
  <li>~abinit/doc/using-configure.txt.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's come back to the case where the build system needs some more
information.  This information should be stored in a file named
hostname.ac, where "hostname" is the result of executing the command
<tt>hostname</tt> on your machine, e.g. testf.pcpm.ucl.ac.be  or
my_machine ... , and taking the first word of the returned chain of
character, e.g. testf or my_machine ...
</p>

<p>
There is a template for such a file, located in
~abinit/doc/config/. Its name is build-config.ac. Examples
of such files, that have been used for testing the package,
can be found in ~abinit/doc/build/config-examples/. By the way, the
known problems observed for these different tests are mentioned
in the ~abinit/KNOWN_PROBLEMS file, and the hostname.ac files
are correspondingly indicated at the beginning of this file.
</p>

<p>
Most of the examples provided in the ~abinit/doc/build/config-examples/
directory contain about five definitions: F90 and C locations, F90 and
C options, MPI library location (or the indication that MPI is not
enabled).  On the other hand, there are many other possible control
flags, needed for advanced use. In case you have trouble with some
library, (NetCDF, LibXC, ETSF_IO, FoX), you may disable their build.
</p>

<p>
Your hostname.ac file might be placed in your home directory
in a new directory that you will name ~/.abinit/build/.
At that location, everytime you install a new version of ABINIT,
the needed information will be found by ABINIT, so you do not
have to care anymore about this file after the first installation.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if you need to play with several computers,
you can place the hostname.ac file directory in the
~abinit directory, where such a hostname.ac file will be also
seen by the build system (and preferred over the one located
in ~/.abinit/build/) or in your build directory (like ~abinit/tmp/).
As mentioned above, you might even type at the terminal the definitions
contained in the hostname.ac file.
</p>

<p>
Note the order of precedence for the location of the hostname.ac file
(or command-line information), in case more than one possibility is
used, (decreasing order of precedence):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Command line (overcome all other information)</li>
  <li>Your build directory (~abinit/tmp/)</li>
  <li>The ABINIT top source directory (~abinit/)</li>
  <li>~/.abinit/build/</li>
  <li>/etc/abinit/build/</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the hostname.ac file is ready, you have to issue, in the ~abinit
directory:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>configure or ./configure  (or first create a tmp directory, then
  cd tmp, create a hostname.ac file, then ../configure)</li>
  <li>make or make  (or make multi for using several processors on a SMP
  machine)</li>
  <li>(optionally) make install</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="make_internal_tests"></a>3. How to make the internal tests?</h2>

<p>
The abinit code has several small internal tests (three non-optional,
and then one for each of the fallbacks bigdft, etsf_io, libxc, wannier90),
that can be issued automatically, and that check themselves whether the
results that have been obtained are right or wrong. At most 3 MB of
memory and 1 MB of disk space are required on your machine for these
tests to work.  These tests are available in all cases (whether you have
got the package from the Web or from the ABINIT archive).
</p>

<p>
You can begin with the test number 1. Simply issue the command:
</p>

<pre><strong>make testin_1</strong></pre>

<p>
It will run during a few seconds. It should print:
</p>
<pre>
 Status file, reporting on test             1

 OK for total energy
 OK for nuclei positions
 OK for forces
 OK for stresses
</pre>

<p>
This means that the internal test 1 ran successfully. If you do
not get this message, then the executables were not properly
generated, or there is a problem with the make and scripts that drive
the internal test. In this case, after having tried to solve the
problem by yourself, you should contact somebody in the ABINIT group.</p>

<p>
Supposing test1 was OK, then you might issue the command:
</p>

<pre><strong>make tests_in</strong></pre>

<p>
The test 1 will be done once more, followed by several other
internal tests. Again, we hope that you will get the positive
diagnostics for the other tests.
</p>

<p>
For further information on these internal tests, see the
~abinit/tests/built-in/README file.</p>

<p>
You might now read the <a href="../users/new_user_guide.html">new
user's guide</a>, in order to learn how to use the code, and then to
follow the four basic tutorials, see the
<a href="../tutorial/welcome.html">entry page for the tutorials</a>. This
is useful if you consider that the installation has been successful. Or
you might continue to read the present Web page, and try to perform the
speed tests, as well as the other tests.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>4. How to make the speed tests? ( temporaly disabled )</h2>
<!--h2><a name="make_speed_tests"></a>4. How to make the speed tests? (sequential version only)</h2>

<p>
When the internal tests run correctly, you might try to ensure that
your installation of ABINIT has produced an executable the speed of
which is "reasonable". For this purpose, you might issue,
<strong>in the directory ~abinit/tests</strong>:
</p>

<pre><strong>make tests_speed</strong></pre>

<p>
Note that, in case you start from one of the binary packages, this
might work only if the software perl is available on your computer and
perl is aliased to a working perl binary. To check
this, issue:
</p>
<pre>perl - -version</pre>
<p>You should get something like:</p>
<pre>
This is perl, v5.8.5 built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi

Copyright 1987-2004, Larry Wall

Perl may be copied only under the terms of either the Artistic License or the
GNU General Public License, which may be found in the Perl 5 source kit.
</pre>

<p>
In case perl is not installed or available, ask your local computer guru.
</p>

<p>
On a XEON 2.8GHz, these tests need about 30 seconds.  All the results
are analyzed automatically, and summarized in the
~abinit/tests/tmp-summary_speed file. You can examine these results, and
compare them to those that you can find on the
<a href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/benchmarks">Benchmark pages
of ABINIT</a>.
Try to find a platform similar to yours. The comparison of frequencies
is important, although a simple rescaling should be enough to compare
similar platforms with different frequencies. Supposing the comparison
gives a 20% difference, your installation is likely fine.
If you find much longer times than those advertised, it is likely
that you have to improve your hostname.ac file, by finding
better compiler flags (see <a href="#make_executable"> section 2 </a>).
</p>

<p>
Supposing you have not yet done so, you might now read the
<a href="../users/new_user_guide.html">new user's guide</a>, in order
to learn how to use the code, and then to follow the four basic
tutorials, see the <a href="../tutorial/welcome.html">entry page for the
tutorials</a>. Alternatively, you might want to continue the tests.</p>
-->
<hr>
<h2><a name="make_tests"></a>5. How to make the other tests?</h2>

<p>
<i><strong>Note: These tests cannot be done if you only got the binaries: only
the minimal testing tools have been included in the corresponding package.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>
Although it is possible to make the other tests without knowing really
how to use the code (since all steps involved - the run and subsequent
analysis - are done automatically), it is important to read the
<a href="../users/new_user_guide.html">new user's guide</a>, and then to
follow the four basic tutorials, see the
<a href="../tutorial/welcome.html">entry page for the tutorials</a>.
</p>

<p>
Let us pursue with the testing procedure. Go to the ~abinit/tests
directory, and issue:
</p>

<pre><strong>make help</strong></pre>

<p>
A whole list of possible sets of tests is given.  A reasonable set of
tests (those contained in the fast, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and v6
directories), produced with a summary, can be run automatically by:
</p>

<pre><strong>make tests_dev</strong></pre>

<p>This is the recommended procedure for developers. In order to execute
these tests, you will need a larger disk space than for the simple
installation of the code (the total additional disk space required is on
the order of 1GB).
</p>

<p>
A more detailed way to control the set of tests is described by typing:
</p>

<pre><strong>make help_dev</strong></pre>

<p>Let us now examine the different subdirectories.</p>

<p>
~ABINIT/tests/fast/ is the simplest, and its content will be described
in some detail below.  For tests of the parallel version see
the directory test/paral/, as well as the ~abinit/doc/paral_use text
file.  For tests of the response function features of abinit, and for
tests of mrgddb and anaddb, see the subdirectories tests/v2.  The other
directories tests/v3, tests/v4, tests/v5 and tests/v6 presents further
tests of recently implemented features of ABINIT.
</p>

<p><strong>1) tests/fast/</strong> (for the sequential version only)</p>

<p>
This subdirectory contains a basic set of tests of the code, aimed
at testing whether the code is coherent in time (successive
versions), and exercising several parts of the code. However, they do
not examine its accuracy on physical problems, mainly because the
number of plane waves used is too small, and some tests are not run
to self-consistent convergence. 32 MB of memory should be enough for these
tests.
</p>

<p>
The description of the tests can be found at the end of the
~abinit/tests/fast/README file.
</p>

<p>
To run only the tests in this directory, simply issue, in the
~abinit/tests/ directory:
</p>

<pre><strong>make tests_fast</strong></pre>

<p>
'make tests_fast' will create a directory whose name will be build from the
machine name and today's date. All the results will be in that
directory. The output files will be automatically compared, thanks to
a 'diff' command, to a set of reference files (in
~abinit/tests/fast/Refs/). The corresponding difference files are
prefixed by 'diff.'.
</p>

<p>
In addition to 'diff', there are two other levels of automatic analysis:
one based on a comparing tool called 'fldiff', producing 'fldiff.report'
files, and another where the output of 'fldiff' is further analyzed, and
produce a brief report called 'report'.  The latter step is only
performed in case all the tests cases of one directory are performed
(including the case where tests of different directories are performed,
like with the "make tests_dev" instruction).
</p>

<p>The one-line summaries produced by fldiff (see later) are compared
with a database (see ~abinit/tests/fast/Input/report.in).  This
procedure produces a file called "report", in which there is a one line
assessment of the behaviour of each test: succeeded (everything is OK),
passed (the test is OK for users in production), passed marginally (the
test is within 1.5 of the usually accepted deviation, which is likely OK
for most applications - still to be improved by the development team,
though), failed (there is a problem, the deviation is usually not
accepted).  This is by far the most convenient tool to analyze the
automatic tests of abinit.
</p>

<p>
As of v6.2 , the vast majority of tests cases succeed or pass on all
platforms that are used by the developer team in Louvain-la-neuve.  Some
problems are mentioned in the file ~abinit/KNOWN_PROBLEMS ,
Additionally, there might be specific problems for some test case for
some platforms, also mentioned in ~abinit/KNOWN_PROBLEMS.  So, apart of
the known problems, mentioned in this file, the "report" file should
mention, for each test case, only "succeeded" or "passed".
</p>

<p>
The comparing tool 'fldiff' -for 'floating diff'- performs in a more
detailed way the comparison of floating numbers between the output files
and the reference files than in the case of a 'diff' command.  As used
presently, for each run inside one directory, one single file, called
'fldiff.report', will be produced, and gather the analysis for all tests
in that directory.
</p>

<p>
If for one test case, the two files differ by the number of lines,
the 'fldiff.report' file will report that it cannot compare the two files.
Usually this problem will be seen at the level of 'command signs' appearing
sometimes in the first column of the output files, so a
typical error message (announcing something went wrong) will be:
</p>

<pre>
Case_1
22
The diff analysis cannot be pursued: the command sign differ.
</pre>

<p>
By contrast, it will identify the floating numbers and ignore their
differences if they are within some prescribed tolerance, or if the
difference is not relevant.  For example, it is able to ignore the
differences in timings.  If everything goes fine for a test, fldiff
should identify only the differences in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the dates of execution (possibly);</li>
  <li>the version numbers (possibly);</li>
  <li>the platform description (possibly);</li>
  <li>the overall execution time (this is ALWAYS printed, even without
  differences).</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, a successful execution of one test case may be announced as follows
in the fldiff.report file:
</p>

<pre>
Case_1
2
<  version 7.1.0  of abinit
>  Version 6.15.2  of ABINIT
5
<  starting date: Thu  6 Dec 2012.
>  Starting date: Fri 10 Aug 2012.
202
< +overall time at end (sec): cpu=          7.1  wall=          8.0
> +Overall time at end (sec): cpu=          7.3  wall=          8.0
Summary Case_1: no significant difference has been found
</pre>

<p>The fldiff.report file will have one such section for each test_case
that was run. It begins with the number of the test case, then
includes a few blocks of three lines: the number of the line
where something is happening, followed by the content of the two lines.
Finally, there is a one-line summary for each test case.
</p>

<p>
More information on the fldiff script can be found in the
~abinit/tests/Scripts/fldiff.pl file.
</p>

<p>
In case all the tests cases of one directory were performed, there is an
additional analysis step, where the one-line summaries produced by
fldiff are compared with a database (see
~abinit/tests/*/Input/report.in).  This procedure produces a file called
"report", in which there is a one line assessment of the behaviour of
each test: succeeded (everything is OK), passed (the test is OK for
users in production), failed (there is a problem).
</p>

<p>
Usually, these tests are run with the sequential version of the
code only. It is possible to make them using the parallel
version of the code, type:
</p>

<pre><strong>make help_dev</strong></pre>

<p>
in the ~abinit/tests directory for some information about this.
</p>

<p><strong>2) tests/v1</strong></p>

<p>
This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those in the
test/fast directory, but that exercise other basic features, like the
treatment of metals, the GGA, the new pseudopotentials, the
multi-dataset mode, the cell parameters optimization, and the spatial
symmetry groups database.  These were developed during the development
time of the version 1 of ABINIT.  Of course, the automatic difference
procedure only compares to recent runs of the ABINIT code.  As for the
'fast' test cases, the fldiff.report and report files are also
available. 64 MB of memory should be enough for these tests.
</p>

<p><strong>3) tests/v2</strong></p>

<p>
This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those in the
test/fast/ directory, but that exercise features not present in the
Plane_Wave code, nor in version 1 of the ABINIT package, mainly the
response function features, and the use of the mrgddb and anaddb codes.
Again, the automatic difference procedure only compares to recent runs
of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast' test cases, the fldiff.report and
report files are also available. 64 MB of memory should be enough for
these tests.
</p>

<p><strong>4) tests/v3, tests/v4, tests/v5, tests/v6, tests/v7, tests/bigdft, tests/etsf_io, tests/libxc, tests/wannier90</strong></p>

<p>
These directories contain tests built in the same spirit as those in the
test/fast/ directory, but that exercise features not present in the
Plane_Wave code, nor in version 1 or 2 of the ABINIT package, noticeably
the use of the GW code, the utilities Cut3d, AIM, .., the PAW ... . Or
the interfacing with fallbacks.  Again, the automatic difference procedure
only compares to recent runs of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast' test
cases, the fldiff.report and report files are also available. 64 MB of
memory should be enough for these tests.
</p>

<p><strong>5) tests/cpu </strong> (for the sequential version only)</p>

<p>
This subdirectory contains the scripts, and input files needed for
testing the cpu time, either on progressively finer real space grids, or
on progressively bigger unit cells.  Please read the README file of this
directory.  Also for this suite of tests is activated with:
</p>

<pre><strong>make tests_cpu</strong></pre>

<p>
Unlike in the previous case, many directories will be created (more than
10 in the present version). Their name begins with the test name (A1,
A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C3, D3), and is followed by the machine name
and the date. Inside these directories, many runs are done.  There is a
'report' file that summarizes the timing of the different runs, and
there is a 'diff' file, that compares these timings with the reference
(output files from a PIV at 2.8 MHz, usually).
</p>

<p>
The structure of these tests is more complex than that of the test/fast/
and test/v1/ directories.  The tools used are the 'serie' scripts
(serieA,serieB, serieC and serieD) as well as the 'getrep' script. For
an explanation, contact the ABINIT group.  For the largest tests (B and
D series), up to 200MB of central memory are required.
</p>

<p><strong>6) tests/paral/ and tests/mpiio/</strong> (need MPI support)</p>

<p>
This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those
in the test/fast/ directory, but that exercise the parallel version
of the ABINIT code.
</p>

<p>
The script ~abinit/tests/Scripts/drive-parallel-tests.sh considers one
of the different input files, and for this file, it will perform first a
sequential run (using abinis), then use the parallel code with
one processing node, then perform different parallel runs with an
increasing number of processing nodes.  As for the other series of test,
the diff and the fldiff utilities are used automatically, and
fldiff.report and report files are produced automatically.

<h2><a name="others"></a>6. Things that are NOT in the installation
packages.</h2>

<ul>

   <li><strong>Many pseudopotentials are not in the installation package:</strong><br />
   The installation files contain a few pseudopotentials, for
   testing purposes, see ~abinit/tests/Psps_for_tests/.
   But many other pseudopotential have been
   generated. There exist presently two complete sets of ready-to-use
   LDA pseudopotentials, for the whole periodic table: those
   generated by Doug Allan and Alex Khein for the plane_wave code,
   and those published by
   Hartwigsen, Goedecker and Hutter (Phys. Rev. B 58, 3641 (1998)).

<h2><a name="modify"></a>7. For developers: how to modify the code?</h2>

<p>
(Of course, you cannot modify the code if you only downloaded a binary
package).
</p>

<h3><a name="modify1"></a>7.1. To modify a file (arguments unchanged).</h3>

<p>
If you want simply to modify the content of an existing file (e.g.  one
of the Fortran files, located in one of the src/* directories), without
changing its list of arguments, and recompile the code, the procedure is
quite simple. Modify that file, and reissue:
</p>

<pre><strong>make</strong></pre>

<p>in ~abinit.</p>

<h3><a name="modify2"></a>7.2. To modify a file (arguments changed).</h3>

<p>
If you want to modify the content of an existing Fortran file as well as
the list of arguments, and recompile the code, the procedure is to
modify that file, and then issue, in the ~abinit directory:
</p>

<pre><strong>*/abilint . .</strong><br /><strong>make</strong></pre>

<p>
Do not forget the two dots in the abilint command.
</p>

<h3><a name="modify3"></a>7.3. To add a Fortran file.</h3>

<p>
If you want to add a new Fortran file, there is a difference whether you
work with or without the autotools.
</p>

<p>
In both cases, you must <strong>add the file name in the abinit.src file of
the corresponding directory</strong>. As an example, suppose that you want to
add a new routine named <strong>blork.F90</strong> in the directory
~abinit/src/65_nonlocal/. Then, you must also declare it in the
~abinit/src/65_nonlocal/abinit.src file.
</p>

<p>
Note that the choice of directory is important. You should choose
to put your new routine in a directory that has a prefix number (e.g. 42
for 42_nlstrain) higher than all the directories that contain routines
you will use (except if the called routines are in the same directory),
and smaller than all the directories that call your routine (except for
routines that are in the same directory as yours).
</p>

<p>
If you work with the autotools, you have now to reissue:
</p>

<pre><strong>*/*/makemake</strong>
<strong>./configure</strong>
<strong>make</strong></pre>

<p>(see <a href="#make_executable">the section 2</a>).</p>

<p>
If you work without the autotools, <strong>you must also modify by hand</strong>
(i.e. find the places where the Fortran files are listed, and complete
the list) the Makefile.in of the directory where the new file has been
added (e.g. ~abinit/src/65_nonlocal/Makefile.in).
</p>

<p>Then issue:</p>

<pre><strong>*/abilint . . </strong>
<strong>make</strong></pre>

<p>in ~abinit/.</p>

<h3><a name="modify4"></a>7.4. To generate the source package.</h3>

<p>
If you want to produce the source package
abinit-<i>x.x.x</i>.tar.gz, type:
</p>

<pre><strong>make dist</strong></pre>

<p>in ~abinit/.</p>

<p>
Do not forget to change its name (e.g. add your name after
<i><strong>x.x.x</strong></i>, to identify that this is a modified version of
ABINIT).
</p>

<!--h3><a name="modify5"></a>7.5. To generate a binary package.</h3>

<div class="warning">
  WARNING: THIS IS OBSOLETE!
</div>

<p>
If you want to produce a binary package abinitbin-<i>x.x.x</i>.tar.gz,
type:
</p>

<pre><strong>make seq</strong></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><strong>make seqpar</strong></pre>

<p>in ~abinit/.</p>

<p>
Do not forget to change its name (e.g. first, add your name after
<i><strong>x.x.x</strong></i>, to identify that this is a modified version of
ABINIT, and second, change the generic "abinitbin" to the nickname of the platform, like pclinux_pathscale, to give
pclinux_pathscale_seq-<i>x.x.x</i>.tar.gz).
