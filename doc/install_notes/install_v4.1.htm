This file provides a description of the operations needed to install
the ABINIT package, to generate the executable and to make the
tests.</P>

<P>See a recent version of the
<a href="../new_user_guide.html">new user's guide</a>, for an
introduction to the abinit package. See a recent version of the
<a href="../abinis_help.html">abinis help</a> file
for learning how to use the code. Both of them can be
found in the Infos subdirectory.</P>

<H2><A NAME="get _version"></A>How to get a version of ABINIT ?</H2>

<P>We will distinguish three cases :</P>

<OL>
   <LI>you have a F90 compiler under UNIX/Linux (or MacOS X) and
   you want to compile the source files.</LI>

   <LI>you run one of the UNIX/Linux (or MacOS X) platforms
   on which ABINIT is installed
   before each release, and you do not want to compile the source files.</LI>

   <LI>you want to run ABINIT under DOS/Windows.</LI>

</OL>

<P>In the three cases, the installation files are available on the web site.</P>

<P>You must download different files for the different cases(<I>x.x.x is the
version</I>).</P>

<P><B>Case 1 (under UNIX/Linux or MacOS X, and you want to compile) :</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>download the file <B>src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>
    </P>
<P><B>or</B></P>
<P>download the four files <B>src_tests<I>X</I>_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>
  where <B><I>X</I></B> is <B><I>A, B, C or D</I></B>
    </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The <B>src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>
   gzipped tar file contains <B>all</B> the sources of the
   ABINIT code (including the files needed for generating the FFTs,
   NumRecip and Lapack libraries), the complete Infos directory, the
   complete set of Tests, all the scripts and makefiles, the
   pseudopotentials needed for tests.<BR>
   It does NOT contain the object files and the binary executable
   files. <BR>
   You might as well download separately four different tar.gz
   files named src_testsA_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz, src_testsB_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz
   src_testsC_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz, and src_testsD_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz .
   This opportunity is provided in case you have a slow connection
   to the ABINIT Web site, and think your ftp connection might be not
   stable enough to download the entire src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz file :
   the four different
   files are each about one quarter of the single file, and altogether they contain
   also the full ABINIT package.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Case 2 (under UNIX/Linux or Mac OS X, and you do not want to compile) :</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>download <B><I>platform</I>_seq_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>,
    for the sequential version only, </P>
 <P><B>or</B></P>
 <P>download <B><I>platform</I>_par_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>,
    for the parallel version only (if it exists for the platform), </P>
 <P><B>or</B></P>
 <P>download <B><I>platform</I>_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>,
    for sequential and parallel versions (if both exist for the platform). </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Such gzipped tar files contains the binary executable
   files (sequential, or parallel, or both),
   the complete Infos directory, and the different files
   needed to execute either the
   <A HREF="#make_internal_tests"><B> 5 internal tests </B></A>
   (sequential version),
   or <A HREF="#make_tests"><B> tests </B></A>
   from the Test_paral directory (parallel version), or both.
   In what follows, we will focus on the
   sequential executable (called abinis). One should begin to use
   the parallel executable (called abinip) only when sufficient
   experience has been gained with abinis. <BR>
   The gzipped tar file does NOT contain the source files,
   neither the Test_fast, Test_v1, Test_v2, Test_v3, Test_v4,
   and Test_cpu directories, nor the corresponding
   pseudopotentials. The possible platforms are :
<UL>
   <LI>pclinux_pgi (PC under Linux, using the Portland Group Inc. compiler),</LI>
   <LI>pclinux_ifc (PC under Linux, using the Intel compiler - a bit faster),</LI>
   <LI>ibm_pw2 (IBM with Power 2 processors),</LI>
   <LI>ibm_44p (IBM model 44P with Power III+ processors),</LI>
   <LI>compaq_ev56 (DEC/Compaq machines with EV56 alpha processors),</LI>

</UL>
   For the Intel/Linux machines, the binaries contain all
   the library routines statically linked. They should be very portable
   (and they have been ported to more than 5 different machines in different
   countries, or of different construction ). However, they have been compiled
   by a compiler that generates code that needs an IP number to work.
   So, they will not run if your machine has not been IP'ed.
   For the other platforms,
   the executable does not contain all the library routines
   (they are linked dynamically), so they might not be as portable.
   The portability of the executable has been checked only
   for IBM PW2 and SGI Origin 2000 platforms.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Case 3 (you want to run ABINIT under DOS/Windows) :</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>download <B>intel_DOSWin_seq_<I>x.x.x</I>.exe</B>,
    for the sequential version.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   This is a self-extracting zip file that contains the binary executable
   files, the complete Infos directory, and the different files
   needed to execute the 5 internal tests. It does NOT contain the source files,
   nor the Test_fast, Test_v1, Test_v2, Test_v3, Test_v4
   and Test_cpu directories, and the corresponding
   pseudopotentials.<BR>
   Note : in order to compile ABINIT under DOS/Windows, you need the PGI workstation
   environment. The procedure to be followed differs from what will be explained
   below, and will not be described.
   Contact the <A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A> if needed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>So, execute the following actions :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>1)</B> Transfer the above-mentioned file(s) to your
   machine, in a directory referred to here as ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> .
   You should have about 100 MB of disk space to install the code,
   maybe more, depending on the version, and the number of tests that you
   will do.

   <P><B>2a)</B> Under UNIX/Linux, gunzip (on some machine you need gzip -d)
   and untar the file
   '<B>src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>' or
   '<B><I>platform</I>_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>' (or the sequential
   or parallel reduction of the latter file) :</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE>gunzip <B>src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B> |
      tar -xvf -

      <P>or</P>

      <P>gunzip <B><I>platform</I>_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B> |
      tar -xvf -</P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

   <P><B>2b)</B> Under Windows, double-click the icon of the file
   intel_DOSWin_seq_x.x.x.exe to retrieve the files and directories.
   You can also run it as a command in a DOS window or use your favorite
   unzipping utility.  </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If correctly done, a whole set of
subdirectories should have been created. One of them is called
'Infos'. It contains many important informations.
In particular, you will find the description of the different
subdirectories in the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/dirs_and_files file.
This file also describes the content of the Infos
directory, that is, all the information files.</P>

<P><B>*** It is strongly adviced to the installer to read (and print) NOW the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/dirs_and_files file. ***</B></P>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="make_executable"></A>How to make the executables ?</H2>

<P>If you were in case 2, then you already have the binary
executables abinis, newsp, mrgddb and anaddb, so that you might skip the present
section and
<A HREF="#make_internal_tests">go to the internal testing</A>.
However, just for fun, if you are in UNIX or Linux, you
can issue the make command, in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>
directory :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This will print the list of the basic keywords for the make
utility. This list of basic keywords is completed by keywords specific to
developers, obtained by typing
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make dev</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We now suppose that you have a F90 compiler and you want to
compile the source files (case 1).
You must provide to the 'make' utility some
information: the location
of F90 and C compilers on your machine, the cpp utility, the blas
library, the location of PERL ...
For this, you must create in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> directory a
file (or a symbolic link) named 'makefile_macros',
that you will have to design starting from already existing example files.
Examples of such files are contained in the subdirectories of the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Machine_dept_files directory.
Actually, if one of the existing 'makefile_macros' file is suitable
for you, you will have simply to issue an instruction like the following :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>ln -s</B> Machine_dept_files/DEC/makefile_macros.newton makefile_macros</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(here, a symbolic link is created, so that 'makefile_macros' refers to
Machine_dept_files/DEC/makefile_macros.newton , a file suitable for
the DEC machine named 'newton' at the PCPM).
In order to generate a new 'makefile_macros' file, a help file
called 'help.makefile_macros' can be found in the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos directory. You can ask some
help to the <A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>.
When you have succeeded to create one such file, please send it
to us, so that it can be maintained in the next versions of the code.</P>


<P>When the 'makefile_macros' file is ready, you will have to issue
the 'make' command, followed by some keyword.</P>

<P>To get the sequential version of all the executables,
you must type :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make allseq</B>
<P> or </P>
<B>make allseq >& log.file</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(allseq is an abbreviation for <I>all sequential</I> executables;
   log.file can be any filename, and is useful
    when the messages from make are too long)</P>

<P>Issuing this 'make allseq' command will trigger a whole set of
actions (not easy to follow, as you will see).<BR>
The make utility will use the file 'Makefile', that calls a script
called 'makemake', to produce another makefile, called
'tmp_makefile', that calls the 'makearch' script from different
subdirectories, that create themselves 'tmp_makefile' files, that
compile the fortran source (and eventually one C file), create
libraries and link the different objects.<BR>
Moreover, usually, this works without problem !</P>

<P>Let's us suppose that you do not issue the powerful 'make allseq'
command, but that you want to create one-by-one the libraries and
executables.</P>

<P>Then, for the sequential version, you must create :</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the lapack library (make lapack)</LI>

   <LI>the numrecip library (make numrecip)</LI>

   <LI>the new FFT library (make fftnew)</LI>

   <LI>the perl scripts (make perl)</LI>

   <LI>and on some platforms, the blas library (make blas)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Alternatively, the libraries can be created at once by
issuing 'make libs'.</P>

<P>Then, you can issue 'make abinis' to make the sequential version
of abinit, and 'make newsp' to make newsp, the wavefunction
translator. The latter is needed for different tests of abinis
(see below). You can also issue 'make mrgddb' to make the
code that merge the derivative databases, 'make anaddb' to make
the code that analyze interatomic force constant,
'make aim' for the Bader analysis utility,
'make cut3d' for the analyzer of three-dimensional density, potential
or wavefunction files...</P>

<P>In order to get a transferable executable on Intel/Linux machines,
it might be needed to generate a static BLAS library. For this purpose,
issue 'make blas'. Be consistent with this choice, at the level
of the 'makefile_macros' file. This possibility is also used
for the Fujitsu machines.</P>

<P>Informations needed to generate the parallel version of ABINIT
can be found in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/paral_use file.
</P>

<P> Suppose that something is going wrong in one of the above-mentioned
steps, then, you can issue one of the 'clean_xxx' keywords (those
mentioned by typing 'make') to clean the directory where something
wrong happened.</P>

<P>With a bit of luck, you will succeed to
generate the executables. You are ready to perform
the tests.</P>

<P>In some cases, one wish to keep the binaries for different platforms
in the same ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> directory. It is
possible to make the
compilation execute in such a way that the result is stored in
a machine-dependent subdirectory. Prior to the compilation on one
platform, issue : </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make bindir</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thanks to this command, a 'tmp_bindir' file will be created,
containing the definition of a variable $(BINDIR). Usually, this
variable will be BinAbinit/machine_architecture ,
where machine_architecture is the result of the execution of the
`arch` command on the platform. This definition
will be included in the make mechanism, and all the binaries
will be put in $(BINDIR). For the compilation on another
platform, the 'make bindir' command must be performed again,
before compilation, and the binaries generated by that other
compilation will be put in the corresponding directory.
It is also possible to change the tmp_bindir file, to define
another location, not obtained by the `arch` command.
Note that, if any, the cleaning will be directed to the $(BINDIR)
directory, which is the expected behaviour. However, presently, the
tests (internal as well as v1, and others) CANNOT use the
executables in the machine-dependent location : if the tests
are to be done, one must first copy the proper executable in the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> directory.
</P>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="make_internal_tests"></A>How to make the internal tests
? (sequential version only) &nbsp;</H2>

<P>The abinis code has five small internal tests, that can be issued
automatically, and that check themselves whether the results that
have been obtained are right or wrong. At most 3 MB of
memory is required, and 1 MB of disk space. PERL must be installed
on your machine for these tests to work. You can get PERL from
<a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a> .
In the DOS/Windows case, perl.exe MUST be
accessible through the DOS PATH</P>

<P>You can begin with the test number 1. Simply issue the command
:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make test1</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It will run during a few seconds. It will first
print&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>cd Test_in; Run 1<BR>
 Built-in test 1 will be run through dotest script<BR>
 dotest: Starting built-in test 1<BR>
 ../abinis &lt; test1.files &gt; test1.log
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>then, you will eventually (if you are on a slow machine) see
different instances of the status file, like the following :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Status file, with repetition rate 49 , status number
   99&nbsp;

   <P>Level abinit : call gstate<BR>
   Level gstate : call brdmin<BR>
   Level brdmin : call scfcv_ini<BR>
   Level scfcv : call vtorho<BR>
   istep = 2<BR>
   Level vtorho : compute rhog</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>then, the important information is as follows :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Status file, reporting on test 1&nbsp;

   <P>OK for total energy<BR>
   OK for nuclei positions<BR>
   OK for forces<BR>
   OK for stresses&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This means that the internal test 1 ran successfully. If you do
not get this message, then the executables were not properly
generated, or there is a problem with the make and scripts that drive
the internal test. In this case, after having tried to solve the
problem by yourself, you should contact somebody in the
<A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>.</P>

<P>Note : the script detects the end of the run by using the 'ps'
command following by a 'grep' command.
This can lead to strange effects if a file whose name contain
'abinis' is currently visualized, or if another job is running under
a name that contains 'abinis'.<BR>
So, close your files before running the tests, and also check that
there are no running jobs whose name contains 'abinis'.</P>

<P>Supposing test1 was OK, then you have to issue the command 'make
tests'.</P>

<P>The test 1 will be done once more, followed by the 4 other
internal tests. Again, we hope that you will get the positive
diagnostics for the other tests. Altogether, these tests are about 50 sec
on a Intel/PIII 450 MHz machine where no other job is running.</P>

<P>For further information on these internal tests, see the file
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Test_in/README .</P>

<P>You might now read the
<a href="../new_user_guide.html">new user's guide</a>, in order
to learn how to use the code. This is useful if
you consider that the installation has been successful, or if
you want to continue the tests.</P>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="make_tests"></A>How to make the other tests (case 1 only)?</H2>

<P>(Case 1 only, since in case 2, only the minimal testing tools have been
transferred)</P>

<P>Although it is possible to make the other tests without knowing
really how to use the code (since all steps involved - the run and subsequent
analysis - are done automatically), it is the right time to read
the <a href="../new_user_guide.html">new user's guide</a>.

<P>After this reading, you should look at the
subdirectory Test_fast, and, later, Test_v1 and
Test_cpu, where tests of the sequential version of ABINIT (abinis) can be
done automatically. For tests of the parallel version (abinip)
see the directory Test_paral, as well as the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/paral_use file.
For tests of the response function features of abinis, and for
tests of mrgddb and anaddb, see the subdirectories Test_v2.
Test_v3 and Test_v4
presents further tests of recently implemented features of ABINIT.</P>

<P>In order to execute these tests, you will need a larger disk space than
for the simple installation of the code (the total additional disk space
required is on the order of 100 MB). After having checked the results
of the tests, the user can easily retain the output files in a
compressed form, and get rid off the wavefunction files by
issuing</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make decrease_size_tests</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> directory. Separate
commands are available for each of the Test directories.</P>

<P>You might as well remove all working directories by issuing </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make clean_tests</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> directory. Separate
commands are available for each of the Test directories. This
command remove all the subdirectories that begin with '_',
which is the case of the working subdirectories. If you want to keep
some of them, remove their initial '_', then issue make clean_tests.
You can still decrease the size of such renamed directories by the
make decrease_size_tests command.</P>

<P><B>1) Test_fast&nbsp; </B> (for the sequential version only)</P>

<P>This subdirectory contains a basic set of tests of the code, aimed
at testing whether the code is coherent in time (successive
versions), and exercising many parts of the code. However, they do
not examine its accuracy on physical problems, mainly because the
number of plane waves used is too small, and some tests are not run
to self-consistent convergence. 32 MB of memory should be enough for these
tests (with no other application running, however).<BR>
Read the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Test_fast/README file
carefully (at least the beginning),
then read the beginning of the scripts 'Run'. Note that
it is a perl script. <BR>
To run the tests, simply issue :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>(Run machine_name) &gt;&amp; log</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where machine_name will usually be the name of your machine (any
other character string is fine, however).</P>

<P>The script will create a directory whose name will be build from the
machine name and today's date. All the results will be in that
directory. The output files will be automatically compared, thanks to
a 'diff' command, to a set of reference files, either from the
plane_wave code (the corresponding difference files are prefixed by
'diff.'), or from a recent run of the ABINIT code (the corresponding
difference files are prefixed by 'difnew.').</P>

<P> In addition to 'diff', another comparing tool called 'fldiff' -for 'floating
diff'- is also used. It treats in a more clever way the comparison
of floating numbers between the output files and the reference files.
As used presently in the 'Run' script, for each run, only one
single file, called 'fldiff.report', will be produced.
If for one test case, the two files differ by the number of lines,
the 'fldiff.report' file will report that it cannot compare the two files.
Usually this problem will be seen at the level of 'command signs' appearing
sometimes in the first column of the output files, so a
typical error message (announcing something went wrong) will be:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Case_1 <BR>
22     <BR>
The diff analysis cannot be pursued : the command sign differ.  <BR>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> By contrast, it will
identify the floating numbers and ignore their differences if they are
within some prescribed tolerance (fldiff should become an expert system
in this respect : for example, in the present version, it is already
able to ignore most differences in timings).
If everything goes fine for a test,
fldiff should identify only the differences in :
<UL>
   <LI> the dates of execution (eventually) ;</LI>

   <LI> the version numbers (eventually) ;</LI>

   <LI> the platform description (eventually) ;</LI>

   <LI> the overall execution time
        (this is ALWAYS printed, even without differences).</LI>
</UL>
So, a successful execution of one test case may be announced as follows
in the fldiff.report file :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Case_1 <BR>
2      <BR>
<  Version 4.1.2  of ABINIT  <BR>
>  Version 4.1.0  of ABINIT  <BR>
5      <BR>
<  Starting date : Tue 28 Jan 2003.  <BR>
>  Starting date : Mon 27 Jan 2003.  <BR>
202    <BR>
< +Overall time at end (sec) : cpu=          7.1  wall=          8.0   <BR>
> +Overall time at end (sec) : cpu=          7.3  wall=          8.0   <BR>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The fldiff.report file will have one such section for each Test_case
that was run. It begins with the number of the test case, then
includes a few blocks of three lines: the number of the line
where something is happening, followed by the content of the two lines.</P>

<P>If differences (besides those described above) are found,
then there is a problem, or the double precision
tolerance needs to be adjusted (as time goes, this should become better).
More information on the
fldiff script can be found in
the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Utilities/fldiff file.
If needed, you can send by e-mail the fldiff.report to the
<A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>
for help understanding it and fixing possible bugs.

<P>This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those
in the Test_fast directory, but that exercise features not present in
the plane_wave code, like the treatment of metals, the GGA, the
new pseudopotentials, the multi-dataset mode, the cell parameters
optimization, and the spatial symmetry groups database.<BR>
These were developed during the development time of the version 1
of ABINIT.<BR>
Of course, the automatic difference procedure only compares to recent
runs of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast' test cases, the fldiff.report
file is also available. 64 MB of memory should be enough for these
tests (with no other application running, however).
Usually, these tests are run with the sequential version of the
code only. It is possible to make them using the parallel
version of the code, but this need to define the COMMAND_PAR
macro in your makefile_macros file.</P>

<P><B>3) Test_v2</B>&nbsp; </P>

<P>This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those
in the Test_fast directory, but that exercise features not present in
the plane_wave code, nor in version 1 of the ABINIT package, mainly
the response function features, and the use of the mrgddb and anaddb
codes.
Again, the automatic difference procedure only compares to recent
runs of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast' test cases, the fldiff.report
file is also available. 64 MB of memory should be enough for these
tests (with no other application running, however). </P>

<P><B>4) Test_v3 and Test_v4 </B>&nbsp; </P>

<P>This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those
in the Test_fast directory, but that exercise features not present in
the plane_wave code, nor in version 1 or 2 of the ABINIT package,
noticeably the use of the GW code, the utilities Cut3d, AIM, ..,
the PAW ... .
Again, the automatic difference procedure only compares to recent
runs of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast' test cases, the fldiff.report
file is also available. 64 MB of memory should be enough for these
tests (with no other application running, however). </P>


<P><B>5) Test_cpu </B> (for the sequential version only)</P>

<P>This subdirectory contains the scripts, and input files needed for
testing the cpu time, either on progressively finer real space grids,
or on progressively bigger unit cells.
Please read the README file of this directory.
Also for this suite of tests, you have simply to issue</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>(Run machine_name) &gt;&amp; log</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Unlike in the previous case, many directories will be created (more
than 10 in the present version). Their name begins with the test name (A1,
A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C3, D3), and is followed by the machine name
and the date. Inside these directories, many runs are done.<BR>
There is a 'report' file that summarizes the timing of the different
runs, and there is a 'diff' file, that compares these timings with
the reference (output files from a PII at 450 MHz, usually).
The structure of these
tests is more complex than that of the Test_fast and Test_v1 directories.
The tools used are the 'serie' scripts (serieA,serieB,
serieC and serieD) as well as the 'getrep' script. For an explanation,
contact the <A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>.
For the largest tests (B and D series), up to 200 MB of central memory
are required.
</P>

<P><B>6) Test_paral</B>&nbsp; (needs both abinis and abinip)</P>

<P>This directory contains tests built in the same spirit as those
in the Test_fast directory, but that exercise the parallel version
of the ABINIT code.<BR>
The 'Run' script consider one of the different input files, and
for this file, it will perform first a sequential
run (using abinis),
then use the parallel code (abinip) with one processing node, then perform
different parallel runs with an increasing number of processing nodes.
As for the other series of test, the diff and the fldiff utilities
are used automatically.</P>


<P><B>7) How to run all the sequential tests, or a subset of these suited
for developers ?</B></P>

<P>In the main directory, it is possible to issue </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make tests_allseq &gt;&amp; log</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>in which case, all the tests in Test_fast, Test_v1, Test_v2,
Test_v3, Test_v4, Tutorial, Test_cpu and the sequential tests of Test_paral
will be issued. The choice of the name of the machine is not let
to the user : it is "test" . </P>

<P>Also in the main directory, if you issue </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make tests_dev &gt;&amp; log</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>the tests in Test_fast, Test_v1, Test_v2,
Test_v3, Test_v4, and the sequential tests of Test_paral
will be issued. As in the preceeding case, the name of the machine
if fixed ("test"). In addition, a summary file, containing
all the fldiff report files is created, then tarred and gzipped.
It is given the name summary_tests.tar.gz, and might be sent by
mail for the merge of a new contribution.</P>

   <LI><B>Pseudopotentials :</B><BR>
   The installation files contain a few pseudopotentials, for
   testing purposes. But many other pseudopotential have been
   generated. There exist presently two complete sets of ready-to-use
   LDA pseudopotentials, for the whole periodic table : those
   generated by Doug Allan and Alex Khein for the plane_wave code,
   and those published by
   Hartwigsen, Goedecker and Hutter (Phys. Rev. B 58, 3641 (1998)).
   Also, the Fritz-Haber-Institute code, that is freely available at
   <A HREF=http://www.FHI-Berlin.MPG.DE/th/fhi98md/fhi98PP>
   http://www.FHI-Berlin.MPG.DE/th/fhi98md/fhi98PP</A>,
   can be used to generate LDA as well as GGA pseudopotentials,
   that can be read by the code after minor modifications,
   see the Web site.

<H2><A NAME="make_installationfiles"></A>
    For advanced users : how to make the installation files ?</H2>

<P><B>Case 1 (source and tests) : you want to produce the file
src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B></P>

<P>Here, for example, we suppose that you have modified
the code (in order to implement a new feature). This modification
works, so it is time to synchronize with the main code. If the
modifications are rather large, it is worthwhile to send your complete
version to the ABINIT group.</P>

<P>First, you should give a version number
to your version. Simply modify the appropriate variable
in the Makefile file of your ~local_ABINIT directory.
Then issue
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make new_version_number</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
to touch the few routines that need this version number, then
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make allseq</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
as for the installation.</P>

<P>When you think everything can be frozen, you must issue
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make src_tests</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
That's all ..</P>

<P><B>Case 2 (version for a specific platform) : you
want to contribute a specific binary executable e.g.
you work on a SGI machine, and want to produce the file
sgi_r14000_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B></P>

<P>The requirements are : all executables (abinis, newsp and abinip) are
working, and you have not erased one of the files needed for the tests,
both sequential and parallel. Also, the version number is supposed correct
(see above to modify it). In this case, simply issue :

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make sgi_r14000 </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

For the sequential version only, or the parallel version only, use

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make sgi_r14000_seq </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
or
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make sgi_r14000_par </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

For the other platforms, use the appropriate platform name, mentioned
at the beginning of the present document, or obtained by typing

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make dev </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
