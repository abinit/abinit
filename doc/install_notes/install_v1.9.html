Installation notes for ABINIT v1.9</CENTER></H1>

<P>

<HR>

This file provides a description of the operations needed to install
the ABINIT package, to generate the executable and to make the
tests.</P>

<P>See a recent version of the file 'new_user_guide', for an
introduction to the abinit package. See a recent version of the file
'abinis_help' for learning how to use the code. Both of them can be
found in the Infos subdirectory.</P>

<P>Any comment of suggestion to improve the procedure will be
welcome ! Simply contact the
<A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>.</P>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="get _version"></A>How to get a version of ABINIT ?</H2>

<P>We will distinguish two cases :</P>

<OL>
   <LI>you have a F90 compiler and you want to compile the source
   files.</LI>

   <LI>you run one of the platforms on which ABINIT is installed
   before each release, and you do not want to compile the source files.</LI>
</OL>

<P>In both cases, all the installation files are available on the web site
(preferred mean of distribution).</P>

<P>You might also get them by a direct access to a machine in
Louvain-la-Neuve, supposing you have received a corresponding UserID.
In case 1), you should have an access to
hilbert.pcpm.ucl.ac.be (or equivalently, bohr.pcpm.ucl.ac.be, since
the disks are NFS-shared).
In case 2), you must access the corresponding platform in
Louvain-la-Neuve (however, the installation files for the
Linux/Intel and CRAY_T3E platforms are located on hilbert.pcpm.ucl.ac.be).</P>

<P>From now on, we suppose that you have either access to the web site,
or to the machine and the proper official directory.</P>

<P>You must get the following files (<I>x.x.x is the
version</I>):</P>

<P><B>Case 1 (you want to compile) :
src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This gzipped tar file contains all the sources of the
   ABINIT code (including the files needed for generating the FFTs,
   NumRecip and Lapack libraries), the complete Infos directory, the
   complete set of Tests, all the scripts and makefiles, the
   pseudopotentials needed for tests.<BR>
   It does NOT contain the object files and the binary executable
   files.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Case 2 (you do not want to compile) :
<I>platform</I>_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This gzipped tar file contains the binary executable
   files, the complete Infos directory, and the different files
   needed to execute the 5 internal tests only.<BR>
   It does NOT contain the source files, or the Test_fast, Test_v1
   and Test_cpu directories, and the corresponding
   pseudopotentials. The possible platforms are :
   intel_linux, ibm_pw2, dec_osf, hp_pa7200, hp_pa8000, sgi_r10000, cray_t3e .
   For the Intel/Linux machines, the binaries contain all
   the library routines statically linked. They should be very portable
   (and they have been ported to more than 5 different machines in different
   countries, or of different constructors). However, they have been compiled
   by a compiler that generates code that needs an IP number to work.
   So, they will not run if your machine has not been IP'ed.
   For the other platforms,
   the executable does not contain all the library routines
   (they are linked dynamically), so they might not be as portable.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>So, execute the following actions :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>1)</B> Transfer the above-mentioned file(s) to your
   machine, in a directory referred to here as ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> .
   You should have about 30 MB of disk space to install the code,
   maybe more, depending on the version.

   <P><B>2)</B> Gunzip (on some machine you need gzip -d) and untar the file
   '<B>src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>' or
   '<B><I>platform</I>_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B>' :</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE>gunzip <B>src_tests_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B> |
      tar -xvf -

      <P>or</P>

      <P>gunzip <B><I>platform</I>_<I>x.x.x</I>.tar.gz</B> |
      tar -xvf -</P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If correctly done, a whole set of
subdirectories should have been created. One of them is called
'Infos'. It contains many important informations.
In particular, you will find the description of the different
subdirectories in the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/content_of_dirs file.
This file also describes the content of the Infos
directory, that is, all the information files.</P>

<P><B>*** It is strongly adviced to the installer to read (and print) NOW the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/content_of_dirs file. ***</B></P>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="make_executable"></A>How to make the executable ?</H2>

<P>If you were in case 2, then you already have the binary
executables abinis and newsp, so that you can skip the present
section and
<A HREF="#make_internal_tests">go to the internal testing</A>.
However, just for fun, you
can issue the make command, in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>
directory :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This will print the list of available keywords for the make
utility.</P>

<P>We now suppose that you have a F90 compiler and you want to
compile the source files (case 1).</P>

<P>You will have to issue again the 'make' command, followed
by some keyword.</P>

<P>To get the sequential version of the two executables abinis and
newsp, you must type :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make allseq</B>
<P> or </P>
<B>make allseq >& log.file</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(allseq is an abbreviation for <I>all sequential</I> executables;
   log.file can be any filename, and is useful
    when the messages from make are too long)</P>

<P>Issuing this 'make allseq' command will trigger a whole set of
actions (not easy to follow, as you will see).<BR>
The make utility will use the file 'Makefile', that calls a script
called 'makemake', to produce another makefile, called
'tmp_makefile', that calls different 'makemake' scripts in different
subdirectories, that create themselves 'tmp_makefile' files, that
compile the fortran source (and eventually one C file), create
libraries and link the different objects.<BR>
Moreover, usually, this works without problem !</P>

<P>However, you must first provide to the 'make' utility some
information: the location
of F90 and C compilers on your machine, the cpp utility, the blas
library ...
For this, you must create in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> directory a
file (or a symbolic link) named 'makefile_macros',
that you will have to design starting from already existing example files.
The 'makemake' scripts use that 'makefile_macros' file to do their job.</P>
Examples of such files are contained in the subdirectories of the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Machine_dept_files directory.
An help file called help.makefile_macros can be found in the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos directory. You can ask some
help to the <A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>.
When you have succeeded to create one such file, please send it
to us, so that it can be maintained in the next versions of the code.</P>

<P>Let's us suppose that you do not issue the powerful 'make allseq'
command, but that you want to create one-by-one the libraries and
executables.</P>

<P>Then, for the sequential version, you must create :</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the lapack library (make lapack)</LI>

   <LI>the numrecip library (make numrecip)</LI>

   <LI>the ffts library (make ffts)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Alternatively, the three libraries can be created at once by
issuing 'make libs'.</P>

<P>Then, you can issue 'make abinis' to make the sequential version
of abinis, and 'make newsp' to make newsp, the wavefunction
translator.</P>

<P>Informations needed to generate the parallel version of ABINIT
can be found in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/paral_use file.
</P>

<P> Suppose that something is going wrong in one of the above-mentioned
steps, then, you can issue one of the 'clean_xxx' keywords (those
mentioned by typing 'make') to clean the directory where something
wrong happened.</P>

<P>With a bit of chance, you will succeed to
generate the executables abinis and newsp. You are ready to perform
the tests.</P>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="make_internal_tests"></A>How to make the internal tests
?&nbsp;</H2>

<P>The abinis code has five internal tests, that can be issued
automatically, and that check themselves whether the results that
have been obtained are right or wrong. At most 3 MB of
memory is required, and 1 MB of disk space.</P>

<P>You can begin with the test number 1. Simply issue the command
:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make test1</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It will run during a dozen of seconds. It will first
print&nbsp;</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>cd Test_in; rm -f *1*o* *1*S ; ../abinis &lt; test1.files
   &gt; test1.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;<BR>
   Test_in/test_end Test_in/test1 ; cat Test_in/test1_STATUS</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>then, you will eventually (if you are on a slow machine) see
different instances of the status file, like the following :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Status file, with repetition rate 20 , status number
   101&nbsp;

   <P>Level abinit : call gstate<BR>
   Level gstate : call brdmin<BR>
   Level brdmin : call scfcv_ini<BR>
   Level scfcv : call vtorho<BR>
   istep = 2<BR>
   Level vtorho : compute rhog</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>then, the important information is as follows :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Status file, reporting on test 1&nbsp;

   <P>OK for total energy<BR>
   OK for nuclei positions<BR>
   OK for forces<BR>
   OK for stresses&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This means that the internal test 1 ran successfully. If you do
not get this message, then the executable were not properly
generated, or there is a problem with the make and scripts that drive
the internal test. In this case, after having tried to solve the
problem by yourself, you should contact somebody in the
<A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>.</P>

<P>Note : the script detects the end of the run by using the 'ps'
command following by a 'grep' command.
This can lead to strange effects if a file whose name contain
'abinis' is currently visualized, or if another job is running under
a name that contains 'abinis'.<BR>
So, close your files before running the tests, and also check that
there are no running jobs whose name contains 'abinis'.</P>

<P>Supposing test1 was OK, then you have to issue the command 'make
tests'.</P>

<P>The test 1 will be done once more, followed by the 4 other
internal tests. Again, we hope that you will get the positive
diagnostics for the other tests. Altogether, these tests are about 1
minute on a PPro 200 MHz machine where no other job is running.</P>

<P>For further information on these internal tests, see the file
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Test_in/README .</P>

<P>You might now read the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/new_user_guide file, in order
to learn how to use the code. This is useful if
you consider that the installation has been successful, or if
you want to continue the tests.</P>

<P>

<HR>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="make_tests"></A>How to make the other tests (case 1 only)?</H2>

<P>(Case 1 only, since in case 2, only the minimal testing tools have been
transferred)</P>

<P>Although it is possible to make the other tests without knowing
really how to use the code (since all steps involved - the run and subsequent
analysis - are done automatically), it is the right time to read
the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/new_user_guide file.

<P>After this reading, should look at the
subdirectory Test_fast, and, later, Test_v1 and
Test_cpu, where tests of the sequential version of ABINIT can be
done automatically. For tests of the parallel version
see the directory Test_paral, as well as the
~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/paral_use file.</P>

<P>In order to execute these tests, you will need a larger disk space than
for the simple installation of the code (the total additional disk space
required is on the order of 50 MB). After having checked the results
of the tests, the user can easily retain the output files in a
compressed form, and get rid off the wavefunction files by
issuing</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>make decrease_size_tests</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>in the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I> directory.</P>

<P><B>1) Test_fast&nbsp;</B></P>

<P>This subdirectory contains a basic set of tests of the code, aimed
at testing whether the code is coherent in time (successive
versions), and exercising many parts of the code. However, they does
not examine its accuracy on physical problems, mainly because the
number of plane waves used is too small, and some tests are not lead
to self-consistent convergence. 32 MB of memory should be enough for these
tests (with no other application running, however).<BR>
This suite of tests is similar to the suite of tests used for the
plane_wave code. There should be reasonable similarity between the
results of the tests for the plane_wave and ABINIT codes.<BR>
Read the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Test_fast/README file
carefully (at least the beginning),
then read the beginning of the scripts 'Run'.<BR>
To run the tests, simply issue :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>(Run machine_name) &gt;&amp; log</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where machine_name will usually be the name of your machine (any
other character string is fine, however).</P>

<P>The script will create a directory whose name will be build from the
machine name and today's date. All the results will be in that
directory. The output files will be automatically compared, thanks to
a 'diff' command, to a set of reference files, either from the
plane_wave code (the corresponding difference files are prefixed by
'diff.'), or from a recent run of the ABINIT code (the corresponding
difference files are prefixed by 'difnew.').</P>

<P> In addition to 'diff', another comparing tool called 'fldiff' -for 'floating
diff'- is also used. It treats in a more clever way the comparison
of floating numbers between the output files and the reference files.
As used presently in the 'Run' script, for each run, only one
single file, called 'fldiff.report', will be produced.
If for one test case, the two files differ by the number of lines,
the 'fldiff.report' file will report that it cannot compare the two files.
Usually this problem will be seen at the level of 'command signs' appearing
sometimes in the first column of the output files, so a
typical error message (announcing something went wrong) will be:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Case_1 <BR>
22     <BR>
The diff analysis cannot be pursued : the command sign differ.  <BR>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> By contrast, it will
identify the floating numbers and ignore their differences if they are
within some prescribed tolerance (fldiff should become an expert system
in this respect : for example, in the present version, it is already
able to ignore most differences in timings).
If everything goes fine for a test,
fldiff should identify only the differences in :
<UL>
   <LI> the dates of execution (eventually) ;</LI>

   <LI> the version numbers (eventually) ;</LI>

   <LI> the platform description (eventually) ;</LI>

   <LI> the overall execution time
        (this is ALWAYS printed, even without differences).</LI>
</UL>
So, a successful execution of one test case may be announced as follows
in the fldiff.report file :</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Case_1 <BR>
2      <BR>
<  Version 1.9.x  of ABINIT  <BR>
>  Version 1.8.2  of ABINIT  <BR>
5      <BR>
<  Starting date : Mon  1 Feb 1999.  <BR>
>  Starting date : Thu 28 Jan 1999.  <BR>
202    <BR>
< +Overall time at end (sec) : cpu=          7.1  wall=          8.0   <BR>
> +Overall time at end (sec) : cpu=          7.3  wall=          8.0   <BR>
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The fldiff.report file will have one such section for each Test_case
that was run. It begins with the number of the test case, then
includes a few blocks of three lines: the number of the line
where something is happening, followed by the content of the two lines.</P>

<P>If differences (beside those described above) are found,
then there is a problem, or the double precision
tolerance needs to be adjusted (as time goes, this should become better).
More information on the
fldiff script can be found in
the ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Utilities/fldiff file.
If needed, you can send by e-mail the fldiff.report to the
<A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>
for advices about it.
&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>2) Test_v1</B>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This directory contains tests build in the same spirit than those
in the Test_fast directory, but that exercise features not present in
the plane_wave code, like the treatment of metals, the GGA, or the
new pseudopotentials.<BR>
These were developped during the time the version 1 of ABINIT was set
up.<BR>
Of course, the automatic difference procedure only compares to recent
runs of the ABINIT code. As for the 'fast' test cases, the fldiff.report
file is also available. 64 MB of memory should be enough for these
tests (with no other application running, however). </P>

<P><B>3) Test_cpu</B></P>

<P>This subdirectory contains the scripts, and input files needed for
testing the cpu time, either on progressively finer real space grids,
or on progressively bigger unit cells.
Please read the README file of this directory.
Also for this suite of tests, you have simply to issue</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>(Run machine_name) &gt;&amp; log</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Unlike in the previous case, many directories will be created (8
in the present version). Their name begins with the test name (A1,
Am2, A3, B1, Bm2, B3, C3, D3), and is followed by the machine name
and the date. Inside these directories, many runs are done.<BR>
There is a 'report' file that summarizes the timing of the different
runs, and there is a 'diff' file, that compares these timings with
the reference (output files from a PPro at 200 MHz). The structure of these
tests is more complex than that of the Test_fast and Test_v1 directories.
The tools used are the 'serie' scripts (serieA,serieB,
serieC and serieD) as well as the 'getrep' script. For an explanation,
contact the <A HREF="mailto:gonze@pcpm.ucl.ac.be"> ABINIT group</A>.
For the largest tests (B and D series), up to 200 MB of central memory
are required.
</P>

<P><B>4) Test_paral</B>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This directory contains tests build in the same spirit than those
in the Test_fast directory, but that exercise the parallel version
of the plane_wave code.<BR>
The 'Run' script consider one of the different input files, and
for this file, it will perform first a sequential
run, then use the parallel code with one processing node, then perform
different parallel runs with an increasing number of processing nodes.
As for the other series of test, the diff and the fldiff utilities
are used automatically.</P>

<H2><A NAME=others></A>Things that are NOT in the installation
files.&nbsp;</H2>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Pseudopotentials :</B><BR>
   The installation files contains a few pseudopotentials, for
   testing purposes. But many other pseudopotential have been
   generated. There exist presently two complete sets of ready-to-use
   LDA pseudopotentials, for the whole periodic table : those
   generated by Doug for the plane_wave code, and those published by
   Hartwigsen, Goedecker and Hutter.
   Doug's pseudopotentials are on the Web site,
   but can also be obtained from him, or can be found in the
   directory ~gonze/ABINITv1/Psps/TM.psps of the hilbert
   machine in Louvain-la-Neuve. The pseudopotentials generated
   by the Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter code, or published in their
   Phys. Rev. B 58, 3641 (1998) paper need minor modifications,
   described in the
   ~local_ABINITv<I>x.x.x</I>/Infos/Psp_infos/psp3.info file.
   In the directory
   ~gonze/ABINITv1/Psps, you will find two pseudopotential
   codes whose output can be read by the ABINIT code, eventually
   after some minor modification. <BR>
   </LI>

   <BR>

   <LI><B>Symmetries and k-point utility :<BR>
   </B>There exist also a utility for generating automatically
   symmetries and k-point for a given unit cell and atomic
   configuration. This utility, called kptgen,
   is available from the Web site, but not contained in
   the installation files.
