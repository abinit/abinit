LmtART
S.Savrasov's LMTO response-function code
http://physics.njit.edu/~savrasov/Programs/index_lmtart.htm
"The program LmtART is an implementation of full-potential
 linear-muffin-tin-orbital method for electronic-structure
 calculations. It is designed to perform band  structure, total energy
 and force  calculations within the methods of density functional theory (DFT).
New version, LmtART 6.20, is now available. Its main features include:
(i) Local (spin) density approximation (LSDA) is avaiable in many
    parametrizations together with the gradient corrected density
    functionals (GGA91 and GGA96).
(ii) Multiple-kappa LMTO basis sets and multi-panel technique.
(iii) Total energy and force calculations for determining the
      equillibrium structure and phonons.
(iv) LDA+U method for strongly correlated systems.
(v) Spin-orbit coupling for heavy elements.
(vi) Finite temperatures
(vii) Full three dimensional treatment of magnetization in
      relativistic calculations including LDA+U.
(viii) Non-collinear magnetizm.
(ix) Tight-binding regime.
(x) Hoppings integrals extraction regime.
(xi) Optical Properties (e1,e2, reflectivity, electron energy loss
    spectra) using LMTO-ASA, LMTO full potential and tight-binding
    only regimes, with spin polarization, spin-orbit coupling, LDA+U included.
    (properly functioning when connected to MStudio.)

The bulk of the program has
been developed at the Max-Planck Institute for Solid State Research
in Stuttgart, Germany. The DMFT extension of LmtART is under
developing in Department of Physics, Rutgers University.
Most of the source codes for the program, as well as installation and
operating instructions can be downloaded from this site. Refer to
specific license agreement and copyright notice when using the LmtART code."

VASP
http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/

The code VASP, based on the SCF algorithm, ultra-soft pseudopotentials,
written in F90 and parallelized using MPI has very nice features. It
is not a freeware, but might be shared in the framework of a
collaborative project (ftp://tph.tuwien.ac.at/vamp/doc).
It has also no response function features.
It seems that "VASP for Windows 9X/NT/2k" is now a commercial product.

the latest package, "WIEN2k"
http://www.wien2k.at/
The program package WIEN2k allows to perform electronic structure
calculations of solids using density functional theory (DFT).
It is based on the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-wave
((L)APW) + local orbitals (lo) method, one among the most accurate
schemes for band structure calculations. In DFT the local (spin) density
approximation (LDA) or the improved version of the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) can be used. WIEN2k is an all-electron scheme
including relativistic effects and has many features.

The periodic structure program "BAND".
(http://www.scm.com/Products/BandInfo.html)
From the WEB page,

    * BAND is a first-principles periodic structure program for the study
      of bulk crystals, polymers, as well as surfaces.
    * It performs electronic structure calculations based on Density
      Functional Theory.
    * It uses numerical and Slater atomic orbitals.
    * BAND avoids pseudo-potential approximations.
    * BAND is often used in heterogeneous catalysis studies.
    * BAND provides densities-of-states (total, partial, population)
      analyses.
    * It can provide the Potential Energy Surface (PES) of, for instance,
      a chemisorption system or a chemical reaction at a metal surface
      (see figures).
    * BAND offers a variety of density functionals.
    * It enables both spin-restricted or spin-unrestricted calculations.
    * It provides an analysis of the "bonding" (cohesive) energy in
      conceptually useful components.
    * BAND calculates Mulliken-type population analyses and the charge
      density Fourier analysis (form factors).
    * A fragment analysis feature is available for decomposition of
      Density-of-States data in terms of the molecular orbitals of
      (molecular) fragments.
    * BAND uses the same relativistic methods (ZORA and spin-orbit) as ADF
      and is well suited to treat heavy nuclei.
    * A time-dependent DFT implementation will enable the accurate
      calculation of frequency-dependent dielectric functions.
