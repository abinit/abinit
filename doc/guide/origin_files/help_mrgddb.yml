  <br>The user is advised to be familiar with the main [[help:abinit]] help file
  before reading the present file.
  It is important to read also the 
  <A href="help_anaddb.html"><B>Analysis of Derivative DataBase code (Anaddb) help file</B></A>
  to complement the present reading.</h3>

## Now come the different sections, numbered.

## Each section must have a title, that will form the table of content.
## This table of content is automatically generated. A tag is also requested, to allow easier maintenance of external links.
## Note the small (one space) indentation for the title and body keys.
sec1:
 title: "Introduction"
 tag: introduction
 body: |
  The mrgddb code has the purpose to merge "transfer" DDBs
  (that were generated from the ABINIT code) to make a complete DDB
  that can be exploited by the Anaddb code.
  
  <p>The input is very simple, and could be given directly at the screen,
  or more conveniently, piped from a file.
  The user should provide first the name of the new (output) DDB.
  He/she should then give a short description (one line) of this new DDB
  that will be created. This line will be printed at the beginning
  of the DDB.
  
  <p>The user should then give the number of DDBs that will be merged, then
  the whole set of filenames for the DDBs to be merged, one on each line.

sec2:
 title: "What is the usefulness of a merging code ?"
 tag: usefulness
 body: |
  <p> The ABINIT code in its present
  version is only able to produce results for one q wavevector
  for each dataset.  A database for more than one q point can thus be created
  using MRGDDB. Also, it is useful to be able to merge different DDBs
  if they are produced independently on different machines.

sec3:
 title: "How does the merging code work ?"
 tag: work
 body: |
  <p>The DDBs are made of two parts. The first
  part is a list of the parameters that were used to make the DDB,
  and the second part lists the 2DTEs and 3DTEs.
  
  The merging code will check if the following variables are exactly
  the same in the different input DDB : natom,
  [[ntypat]], [[nband]], [[acell]], [[amu]], [[ecut]], [[ixc]], lloc, [[ngfft]], [[occ]], [[rprim]],
  [[typat]], [[xred]], zion.
  
  For [[nband]] and [[occ]], the value of [[occopt]] is taken into account
  (see abinit help file). If possible, MRGDDB will produce
  a DDB with occopt=0.
  
  In case of two different data sets, the code will print an error message and stop.
  The code cannot merge two DDB that have been generated
  using two different geometries
  or convergence ([[ecut]], ...) parameters.
  
  The only exception is connected to the possibility to use Time-reversal
  symmetry to decrease the number of special k points when the
  wavevector of the perturbation is Gamma. In that case, the code
  will merge the DDBs and put the largest set of k-points inside
  the new DDB.
  
  MRGDDB will copy the latest date of the transfer or current
  DDB and copy it in the new DDB.
  
  It will also take the less accurate tolwfr and copy it in the new DDB.
  
  This ends the first part of the action of MRGDDB, namely
  to compare the information of the two different DDB.
  
  When the checking is done, MRGDDB will check the content
  of the different data blocks and constitute the new DDB by
  copying sequentially the non-identical blocks and merging the
  identical blocks. In case two elements are identical, MRGDDB
  copies the value of the transfer DDB.
  (This latter property makes it easy to get rid of old, erroneous data
  and put new, correct data in its place)
  
  Finally, the summary of the block content of the DDB is provided
  at the end of the DDB file.
