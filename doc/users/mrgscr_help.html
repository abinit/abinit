 The mrgscr is a utility that comes with the ABINIT code.
 It is used to merge partial screening files. These files
 contain the screening calculated on some selected q points
 generated using the input variables 'nqptdm' and 'qptdm'.
 The mrgscr utility merge these files into a single file
 that contain the screening on the full list of q points.

 Like other utilities within ABINIT (e.g. mrgddb, mrgkk), the
 input is very simple, and could be given directly at the screen,
 or more conveniently, piped from a file.

 The user should give the number of SCRs that will be merged in the
 first line, then the name of the output file in the second line, after
 what he/she shall write the whole set of filenames for the SCRs to be
 merged, one on each line.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Why such utility can be useful?

 The GW part of ABINIT code in its present version (5.x) is not yet
 parallelized. The input variables 'nqptdm' and 'qptdm' are meant to be
 used as a kind of manual parallelization by splitting the whole
 screening calculation into several smaller jobs which can be submitted
 into several machines simultaneously. mrgscr later can be used to 
 merge the several output SCRs into a single file.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------

 How does the mrgscr code work ?


 First the code reads the header of the first partial file, then it
 calculates the full list of q points that should exist in the full
 screening file. Then it checks the consistency of the other files and
 the existing q points in each file. Last it merges the files into a
 single file, but it worth to say here that merging WILL NOT be
 successful and no output file will be generated if:

 1) the files are not consistent, i.e, different PPs, different DM size
 etc.; usually the files MUST be generated under same conditions for
 every single input variable, except of course for 'nqptdm' and =20
 'qptdm'.

 2) the various input partial screening files can not form a complete
 file via merging. This often happen if the user still have one or =20
 more q
 points on which screening still need to be calculated.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 What if there is a repetition of one or more q points through =20
 different
 input partial screening files?

 No problem, the code will include only one q point from every two
 repeated q points, and will report it in the log file.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 How to check the status of the resulting screening file, or partial
 files, what is there, what is needed, etc.?

 mrgscr can do it, the user only need to use a two-line input file. The
 first line of the input file should be 0, then the second line should
 contain the name of the file to be checked. The result of the checking
 is reported through the log file.

 examples

 merging case
 3                    <== the number of files to be merged
 out                  <== name of out put file
 1_SCR                <== start:name of the files, to be merged
 2_SCR
 3_SCR
 1                    <== to merge q-points (2 = to merge frequencies) 


 checking case

 0                    <== just write zero
 1_SCR                <== the name of the file to be checked
