Netiquette for ABINIT forum/developer MLs

The ABINIT MLs are available for fruitful information exchange among
ABINITioners, thanks to the UCL system and the administrators' hard
work. <br>
<br>
Now the number of the accounts in the forum ML gets over 500 from many
countries, i.e. <span style="font-weight: bold;">GLOBAL</span>. Since
our "common sense" may differ from country to country, we strongly feel
that we need set up our etiquette to keep the MLs effective. Thus those
who want to post e-mails (esp. questions) to the MLs should follow a
sort of etiquette ("<a
 href="http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/netiquette">netiquette</a>")
to make the MLs most effective, and the burden of our limited resource
("humanware" as well as hardware) little as possible. <br>
<br>
Our netiquette will be:<br>
------ <br>
<ol>
  <li>Before posting, <span style="font-weight: bold;">please check
relevant documents</span>
in
ABINIT source archives (src_tests_*.tar.gz) as well as <a
 href="https://sympa-2.sipr.ucl.ac.be/abinit.org/lists">the ML archives</a>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Try to make your post
"beautiful" as possible</span>. Specifically speaking,</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Give a meaningful Subject to your e-mail that may help us to
find/remember your post easily. We should avoid
"HELP","PLEASE","Question", (BLANK), ...</li>
    <li>Do not cite e-mails that are not relevant to your post. When
you want to start a new thread, please do not post by follow-up (reply).
This is important, for Mailers/ML web pages make the most use of
"thread" idea. </li>
    <li>Please avoid two-byte characters in your e-mails. (Especially
for Asian subscribers, e.g. Chinese characters for "month", "date",
"year" etc.).&#160;</li>
    <li>Please stick to PLAIN TEXT format for posting.&#160;About "HOW TO
SEND YOUR E-MAIL in PLAIN TEXT ?", you can consult with the online help
of your Mailer. The following hyperlinks may also be helpful.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>For <span style="font-style: italic;">MS Outlook Express </span>Users:"<a
 href="http://email.about.com/cs/oetipstricks/qt/et012401.htm">Send
Plain Text Messages by Default</a>","<a
 href="http://email.about.com/cs/oetipstricks/qt/et082301.htm">Send a
Message in Plain Text</a>."</li>
    <li>For <span style="font-style: italic;">MS Outlook </span>Users:
"<a href="http://email.about.com/cs/outlooktips/qt/et052902.htm">Set
the Default Message Format</a>","<a
 href="http://email.about.com/cs/outlooktips/qt/et070203.htm">Send a
Plain Text Message</a>"," <a
 href="http://email.about.com/cs/outlooktips/qt/et060702.htm">Write a
Message Using a Specific Message Format</a>."</li>
    <li>For <span style="font-style: italic;">Other Mailer </span>Users:
visit <a href="http://email.about.com/od/getthemostoutofemail/">this
site</a> and&#160;find a solution to send your e-mail as plain text format.
Otherwise, try "<a href="http://www.google.com">Googling</a>." </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Try to make your post "small" as
possible.</span> Specifically speaking,</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Make a good summary about your results: <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific &amp; Concise</span>.
Follow the spirit described in the 
 <a href="http://www.abinit.org/community/?text=bug_report">FAQ2</a>. Just a
small, relevant portion (e.g. ending part) of Log/Output files could be
cited. Whole/complete Input files should be attached (if applicable),
rather than whole Log/Outputs.</li>
    <li>If you still want to attach an output/log (as a whole), please
compress with bzip2, gzip, zip etc. (NB: this is no effective for binary
files, of course) </li>
    <li> If you might have attachment over 500KByte, please stop
attachment ! (Such large-sized e-mail is now automatically blocked for
the distribution, to save Mail Servers in the world.) &#160;Instead ...</li>
    <ul>
      <li>You might put your files to an anonymous ftp server. Our
anonymous ftp site "ftp.abinit.org/pub/incoming" is available for this
purpose.(NB: for the security reason, you must give the full path of
your file for distribution. 
</li>
      <li>It will also be a good idea to have your WEB page. You can
put your outputs (and images) FREELY on your home page. You could
suggest by saying, "Please visit my homepage http://www.foo.foo/ for the
details." Having your own WEB page may be more effective than posting
your questions daily; we should remember, many posts may be overlooked
in our ML inbox, once we have too heavy traffic on the MLs. For those
who do not have your own web server, you may use <a
 href="https://sympa-2.sipr.ucl.ac.be/abinit.org/d_read/forum/">our shared web page</a>.
The entrance (registration) is at the "<a
 href="https://sympa-2.sipr.ucl.ac.be/abinit.org/d_read/forum/">Login</a>"
button on the page (upper left). </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Please try feedback when you
obtain suggestions/comments.</span> Making a good summary will be welcome ! 
In this way, we have chances to contribute to ABINIT.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Please remember, the MLs are not
for so-called "user-support"</span>; we should also recall, "Nobody is
paid to give a service to the ABINIT community." Let us put aside the
idea, "What can ABINIT/ABINITioners do for me (free-of-charge) ?" Let us
think this way, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"What can I do for
ABINIT/ABINITioners ?"</span> and try positive contributions. 
Please do not reiterate your questions just for the aim to draw our
attentions; it would not be effective, because your e-mails might be
filed/blocked as <a
 href="http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/spam">SPAM</a>..</li>
</ol>
