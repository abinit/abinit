<h3><b>0. Introducing the computation of responses</b></h3>
 <p>ABINIT can compute the response to different perturbations, and provide access to quantities
that are second derivatives of total energy (2DTE)
with respect to these perturbations.
Presently, they can be of three types : (1) phonons,
(2) static homogeneous electric field, and (3) strain.
The physical properties connected to 2DTE with
respect to perturbations (1) and (2) are the phonon dynamical matrices,
the dielectric tensor, and the Born effective charges, while
the additional strain perturbation (3), mixed
with phonon and electric field leads to elastic constant,
internal strain, and piezoelectricity.

<p> More functionalities of the computation of responses should
be implemented sooner or later. The alchemical perturbation is
one of the candidates, as well as the homogeneous magnetic field perturbation.
Some third derivatives
of the total energy (3DTE) are also implemented.
The 3DTE might give phonon-phonon coupling, non-linear electric response,
anharmonic elastic constants, Gruneisen parameters,...

<p> The basic quantities that ABINIT will compute are the
FIRST-order derivatives of the wavefunctions (1WF) with respect to
these perturbations. The later calculation of the 2DTE and 3DTE
from these 1WF is an easy computational task : the construction of
the 2DTE with respect to perturbations j1 and j2 involves mainly
evaluating matrix elements between the 1WF of j1 and/or the 1WF of j2.
More details on this technique can be found in
<cite>X. Gonze, Phys. Rev. B55, 10337 (1997)</cite>
and
<cite>X. Gonze and C. Lee, Phys. Rev. B55, 10355 (1997)</cite>.

<p>The calculation of the 1WF for a particular perturbation is done
using a variational principle and an algorithm rather similar
to the one used to find the ground-state (unperturbed) wavefunctions.
Thus, a lot of technical details and parameters are the same
for both ground-state and response-function calculations.
This justifies the development of one unique code for these two classes
of properties : many of the routines of abinit are common in these
calculations, or had to be duplicated, but with relatively small modifications.

<p>
The ABINIT code performs a rather primitive analysis
of the calculated 2DTEs.
For example, it gives the phonon frequencies,
electronic dielectric tensor and effective charges. But
the main output of the code is the Derivative DataBase (DDB) :
a file that contains the set of all 2DTEs and 3DTEs calculated by the
code. This DDB can be manipulated by the MRGDDB code, and fully analyzed
by the Anaddb code. See the corresponding help files
(<A href="help_mrgddb.html">Mrgddb help file</A>,
and
<A href="help_anaddb.html">Anaddb help file</A>).

<h3><b>1. Description of perturbations</b></h3>
 <p>The perturbation of the <b>phonon</b> type is the displacement of one
atom along one of the axis of the unit cell, by a unit of length
(in reduced coordinates). It is characterized by two integer
numbers and one wavevector. The two integer numbers are
the number of the moved atom, which will be noted "ipert", and
the number of the axis of the unit cell, which will be noted "idir".
"ipert" for phonon perturbation can have values between 1 and
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#natom">natom</a>,
"idir" can have values between 1 and 3.
The set of all possible phonon perturbations for one wavevector
has thus (3*<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#natom">natom</a>) elements.
From this basis set, all phonons can be
constructed by linear combination.
The set of atoms to be moved in one dataset of ABINIT is determined
by the input variable <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_dfpt.html#rfatpol">rfatpol</a>.
The set of directions to be considered in one dataset of ABINIT is determined
by the input variable <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_dfpt.html#rfdir">rfdir</a>.
The wavevector to be considered in one dataset of ABINIT is determined
by the input variables <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gstate.html#nqpt">nqpt</a>,
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gstate.html#qpt">qpt</a>, and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gstate.html#qptnrm">qptnrm</a>.

  <p> <i>If you follow the tutorial, you should go back to the tutorial window now. </i>

<p>
The perturbations of the <b>electric field</b> type are
<ul>
 <li> the application of the homogeneous electric field along the
axes of the reciprocal lattice
 <li> the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to
the electronic wavevector along the axes of the Brillouin zone
(which gives derivatives of wavefunctions
with respect to their wavevector), an <b>auxiliary</b> quantity needed
<b>before</b> the application of the homogeneous electric field.
The perturbation is the change of wavevector by dk in the Hamiltonian,
hence the perturbation is referred to as the derivative dk perturbation
("ddk" perturbation).
</ul>

<p>
Note 1 : the ddk perturbation is defined as the derivative with respect
to k in reduced coordinates; this is equivalent to applying
a linear perturbation of strength 2*pi along the conjugate direction
in real space. This statement comes from the derivation of the
phase factor exp(i*2*pi*k*r) with respect to k in reduced coordinates.

<p>
Note 2 : in case the electric field type perturbation is computed inside
a finite electric field, the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to
the electronic wavevector is not computed : everything is done
by a finite-difference technique. Also, the definition of the
homogeneous electric field perturbation is not along the
axes of the reciprocal lattice, but in cartesian coordinates.
Sorry for the possible confusion ...


<p>
These electric-type perturbations are also characterized by two numbers :
"ipert" being natom+1 for the ddk perturbation and natom+2 for the
electric field, and "idir" being 1, 2 or 3, as for phonon perturbations.
Although the possibility of electric field characterized by
a non-zero wavevector is envisioned for a future version of the code,
at present only homogeneous fields are considered. So the wavevector
of the electric field type perturbations is Gamma (q=0).

<p>
The perturbations of the <b>strain</b> type are either an uniaxial strain
or a shear strain. The strain perturbations are considered
in cartesian coordinates (x,y,z).
They are characterized by two numbers,
with "ipert" being natom+3 for the uniaxial strains, and natom+4
for the shear strains, and "idir" describe the particular component.
Explicitly, for uniaxial strains, idir=1 gives the xx strain perturbation,
idir=2 gives the yy strain perturbation, idir=3 gives the zz strain perturbation,
while for shear strains, idir=1 gives the yz strain perturbation,
idir=2 gives the xz perturbation, and idir=3 gives the xy perturbation.
<br>
Note that the "rigid-atom" elastic constants,
as output of ABINIT, are those obtained with <b>frozen</b> internal
coordinates. The internal coordinate relaxation, needed to give
"physical" elastic constants can be handled through the knowledge
of the internal strain and dynamical matrix at Gamma, in ANADDB.
<br>
Of course, if all the internal coordinate are fixed by symmetry, all the
internal strains vanish, and the "rigid-atom" and "physical" elastic
constants are equal.
<br>
Limitations of the present implementation (as of v5.7):
<ul>
 <li> Symmetry is presently used to skip redundant k points in the
          BZ sum, but not to skip redundant strain perturbations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We also define the index of the perturbation, called
"pertcase", equal to idir + 3*ipert. Accordingly, pertcase runs from 1 to 3*(natom+4),
and will be needed to identify output and input files,
see <a href="#6">section 6</a> .

<p>
To summarize, the perturbations are characterized by two numbers,
"ipert" from 1 to natom+4, and "idir", from 1 to 3, as well as
one wavevector (that is gamma when a non-phonon perturbation is
considered); a number called "pertcase" combines "ipert" and "idir", and
runs from 1 to 3*(natom+4).

<p>
The 2DTE, being derivative of the total energy with respect
to two perturbations, will be characterized by
two sets of (idir,ipert), or
by two pertcase numbers, while 3DTE will need three such sets or
pertcase numbers. In addition they will depend on one wavevector (for 2DTE)
or two wavevectors (for 3DTE).

<p>
In the present (non-stationary) implementation of the 2DTE,
the first pertcase corresponds to
the perturbation that gives the derivative of the
potential, and the second pertcase corresponds to the perturbation
that gives the derivative of the wavefunctions.

<h3><b>2. Filenames and input of ground-state wavefunctions</b></h3>
 <p>The same 'files' file as for GS calculations is used for RF calculations.
Actually, in the multi-dataset mode, one will be able to make in one
ABINIT run, ground-state computations as well as response-function
computations, so that the 'files' file must be the same....
The 'input' file will have many common input variables for these different cases,
but also some separate ones.

<p>
Two ground-state wavefunction files might be needed :
<ul>
 <li> the file of ground-state wavefunctions at a set of special points k,</li>
 <li> the file of ground-state wavefunctions at the corresponding k+q,
   where q is the wavevector of the perturbation</li>
</ul>
These files also contain the corresponding eigenvalues.

<p>
Note that the second file (k+q) will be identical to the first one (k), in the case
of zero-wavevector perturbation. Also, if the q-wavevector
maps the k-point grid onto itself (q being the difference between
points that belong to the grid), all the information on the k+q
grid is contained in the k grid, a fact that ABINIT is able to exploit.

<p>
One should have a look at the input variables
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#irdwfk">irdwfk</a>, and
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#irdwfq">irdwfq</a>,
for a description of the ground-state wavefunction file names
generated from the root names provided in the 'files' file.
In the multi-dataset mode, the following input variables will be relevant :
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#getwfk">getwfk</a>, and
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#getwfq">getwfq</a>.
The file names of the ground-state wavefunction file
follow the same convention as for the ground-state case. Thus, the
corresponding section
of the <a href="help_abinit.html#4">abinit help</a> file can be read,
if needed.

<p>
In the case of an electric field perturbation, the output 1WF of the
corresponding ddk perturbation is needed as input.
If the option <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_dfpt.html#rfelfd">rfelfd</a>=1 is used,
then the code will take care
of doing first the derivative dk perturbation calculation, then write
the 1WF at the correct place, as an output file,
then begin the homogeneous field perturbation calculation.
Usually, the use of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_dfpt.html#rfelfd">rfelfd</a>=1 is not recommended,
as the ddk computation is the most often done with different parameters
as the electric field perturbation.

<p>
The nomenclature of first-order wavefunction files is also given
in the <a href="help_abinit.html#4">abinit help</a> file, but it is worth
to specify it in more detail here.
The root name is formed from the string of character in the
third line of the 'files' file (for an input file) or
the fourth line of the 'files' file (for an output file), that is complemented,
in the multi-dataset mode, by '<b>_DS</b>' and the dataset pertcase (the index of the perturbation).
Then, the string '<b>_1WF</b>' is added, followed by pertcase.
This gives, e.g., for a 'files' file whose fourth
line is '/tmp/o', for the dataset number 3, and a perturbation
corresponding to the displacement of the second atom in the x direction
(pertcase=4), the following name of the corresponding 1st-order wavefunction output file:
<pre>
 /tmp/o_DS3_1WF4
</pre>
Such a file might be used as input of another computation, or of another dataset.

<p>
The relevant input variables are :
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#ird1wf">ird1wf</a>, and
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#irdddk">irdddk</a>, as well as
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#get1wf">get1wf</a>, and
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#getddk">getddk</a>, in the multi-dataset mode.

<a name="3"> </a>
<h3><b>3. The use of symmetries</b></h3>
 <p>In order to understand correctly the behaviour
of response-function runs, some information on the use of symmetries
must be given.
<p>
Some perturbations (including their wavevector) may be invariant
for some symmetries. ABINIT is able to
use symmetries to skip perturbations of which a symmetric
has already been calculated (except in the case of strain perturbations).
ABINIT is also
able to use the symmetries that keeps the perturbations
invariant to reduce the number of k points needed for the sampling
of electronic wavefunctions in the Brillouin zone
(although this feature is not optimal yet).
There is one exception to this, the ddk perturbation,
for which the spatial symmetries cannot be used yet.

<p>
In any case, unlike for the ground-state, the input k-point set
for response function should NOT have been decreased by using
spatial symmetries, prior to the loop over perturbations
(see section <a href="#4">4</a>).
Only the time-reversal symmetry, retained by calculations
at q=0, ought to be used to decrease this input k-point set.
Considering each perturbation in turn, ABINIT
will be able to select from this non-reduced set of k-points,
the proper k-point set, automatically, by using the symmetries
that leave each perturbation invariant.

<p>
Accordingly, the preferred way to generate the k-point grid is of course to
use the <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#ngkpt">ngkpt</a> or
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gstate.html#kptrlatt">kptrlatt</a> input variables,
with different values of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a> :
<ul>
 <li> <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1 for the ground state</li>
 <li> <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2 for response functions at q=0 </li>
 <li> <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=3 for response functions at non-zero q </li>
</ul>

<h3><b>4. Organisation of response-function computations</b></h3>
 <p>In agreement with the information provided in the previous sections,
different cases can be distinguished.

<p>
When one considers the response to an atomic displacement with q=0,
the following procedure is suggested :
<ul>
 <li>first, a self-consistent ground-state computation with the restricted set of special points
   in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>second, a self-consistent response-function computation with the atomic displacement
   perturbation, with the half set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2)</li>
</ul>

<p>
When one considers the response to an electric field (with q=0),
the following procedure is suggested :
<ul>
 <li>first, a self-consistent ground-state computation with the restricted set of special points
   in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>second, a non-self-consistent response-function computation of the d/dk
   perturbation, with the half set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2, and
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#iscf">iscf</a>=-3)</li>
 <li>third, a self-consistent response-function computation of the electric field
   perturbation, with the half set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2)</li>
</ul>

<p>
When one considers the response to an atomic displacement in the
special case where q connects k-points that both belong to the special k-point grid,
the following procedure is suggested :
<ul>
 <li>first, a self-consistent ground-state computation with the restricted set of special points
   in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>second, a self-consistent response-function computation of the atomic displacement
   perturbation, with the full set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=3)</li>
</ul>

<p>
When one considers the response to an atomic displacement for a general q point,
the following procedure is suggested :
<ul>
 <li>first, a self-consistent ground-state computation with the restricted set of special points
   in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>second, a non-self-consistent ground-state  run with the set of k+q points,
   that might be reduced thanks to symmetries
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>third, a self-consistent response-function computation of the atomic displacement
   perturbation, with the full set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=3)</li>
</ul>

<p> Of course, these different steps can be combined when a set of responses
is looked for. In particular, the computations of responses at gamma, in the case
where the full dynamical matrix as well as the dielectric tensor and
the Born effective charges are needed, can be combined as follows :
<ul>
 <li>first, a self-consistent ground-state computation with the restricted set of special points
   in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>second, the three non-self-consistent response-function computations
   (one for each direction)
   of the d/dk perturbation, with the half set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2, and
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#iscf">iscf</a>=-3)</li>
 <li>third, all the self-consistent response-function computations of the electric field
   perturbations and of the atomic displacements, with the half set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2)</li>
</ul>
Still, computations of perturbations at different q wavevectors cannot be mixed.
But they can follow the other computations. Supposing that perturbations
at q=0 and a general q point are to be performed, they will be combined
as follows :
<ul>
 <li>first, a self-consistent ground-state computation with the restricted set of special points
   in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>second, the three non-self-consistent response-function computations
   (one for each direction)
   of the d/dk perturbation, with the half set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2, and
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#iscf">iscf</a>=-3)</li>
 <li>third, all q=0 self-consistent response-function computations of the electric field
   perturbations and of the atomic displacements, with the half set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=2)</li>
 <li>fourth, a non-self-consistent ground-state computation with the set of k+q points,
   that might be reduced thanks to symmetries
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1)</li>
 <li>fifth, the self-consistent response-function computations of the atomic displacement
   perturbations with a q wavevector, with the full set of special points
   (with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=3)</li>
</ul>

<p> Note that
the error in the 2DTE is <b>linear</b> in the <b>ground-state</b>
 wavefunction error
(unlike the error due to the 1WFs). Moreover, a large prefactor is
associated with this source of error (it can even cause cause
the instability of the SCF procedure).
As a consequence, the convergence of the ground-state wavefunction
should be very good.
The same is true at the level of the ddk wavefunctions.

<p>
As mentioned in the introduction, inside the response-function
part of the code, the calculation proceeds in two steps :
first the calculation of the first order derivative of the wavefunctions
(1WF), then the combinations of these 1WF to build the 2DTE and 3DTE.

<p>
In an initialisation part, the input file and all the ground-state
files are read, and a few basic quantities are constructed.

<p>
In the first part, every perturbation is examined, one at a time,
separately :
<ul>
 <li>A file containing previous RF wavefunctions is eventually read.</li>
 <li>The minimisation of the variational expression is
    performed, and this procedure generates the 1WF as well
    as the first-order density and potential.</li>
 <li>It is possible, knowing these
    quantities for the perturbation ipert1, to construct
    all the 2DTE with respect to this perturbation and any ipert2,
    except for ipert2 being an homogeneous electric field,
    in which case the derivative of the ground-state wavefunctions
    with respect to their wavevector (ddk) is also needed.
    This feature has been implemented for ipert2 being
    any phonon (of the same wavevector than ipert1), or
    an homogeneous electric field.</li>
 <li>The first-order wavefunctions (1WF) are written
    as well as the first-order density or potential (if requested).</li>

<h3><b>6. The different output files</b></h3>
 <p>Output from the code goes to several places listed below.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a name="6.1"></a>6.1. The log file</b></p>
<p>
This file is the same as the log file
of the abinit code when computing ground state (GS) results.
Eventually, the output of datasets related to response functions
will be intertwined with those concerned with ground-state
case. The purpose of this file is the same as in the GS
case, and the use of error messages is unchanged.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a name="6.2"></a>6.2. The main output file</b></p>
<p>
This file is the same as the main output file
of the abinit code when computing ground state (GS) results.
Eventually, the output of datasets related to response functions
will be intertwined with those concerned with ground-state
case.
We explain here the parts related to the RF computation.

<p>
The initialisation part is the same as for the GS.
So, the reader is advised to read the section
<a href="help_abinit.html#outputfile">6.2</a> the abinit help file,
as well as the first paragraph of the section
<a href="help_abinit.html#6.3">6.3</a> of this file.
Afterwards, the content of the main output file differs a bit...

<p>
The main output file reports on the initialisation of
the ground-state wavefunctions
at k+q, then the loop on the perturbations begins.
For each perturbation, there is :
<ul>
 <li>a short description of the perturbation</li>
 <li>the timing information</li>
 <li>the report on the initialisation of the 1WF</li>
 <li>then the iterations for the minimisation begin, and the output	
          file describes the number of the iteration, the second
          derivative of the total energy obtained ( 2DTEnergy
          in Ha), the change in 2DTEnergy since last iteration,
          the maximum residual over all bands and k points,
          and the square of the potential residual.</li>
 <li>after the iterations are completed, the residuals are reported</li>
 <li>in case of the derivative dk perturbation, ek2 (to be explained)
          and the f-sum rule ratio value are printed. The f-sum rule
          ratio should be close to 1 (not when ecutsm/=0, however).</li>
 <li>then the components of the 2DTEnergy, broken in at most
          14 pieces, depending on the perturbation</li>
 <li>then the 2DTEnergy in Hartree and in eV</li>
 <li>then the relaxation contribution (caused by changes in
          wavefunctions), and the non-relaxation contribution
          (Ewald and frozen-wavefunction contribution)</li>
 <li>then the 2DTEnergy evaluated using a non-variational expression.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After the computation of each perturbation, the output file
reports on the 2DTE matrix elements.
This part is not executed if the only perturbation
is the derivative dk perturbation.
It will give the following information :
<ul>
 <li>if <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#prtvol">prtvol</a>=1 or bigger, 
        the full detail of every contribution to the 2DTE
        in reduced coordinates.</li>
 <li>the 2DTE in reduced coordinates.</li>
 <li>then it will use the 2DTE to perform already some analysis of the
        data without use the Mrgddb and Anaddb codes, namely :
        the full dynamical matrix (cartesian coordinates, masses included)
        the effective charges, and the dielectric tensor,
        the phonon frequencies (including the analysis of the non-
        analyticity if we are at Gamma). Note that phonon frequencies
        lower than 1.0d-8Ha (absolute value) are automatically set to zero,
        while imaginary phonon frequencies (square roots of negative eigenvalues -
        indicating an instability) are printed as negative (this facilitates
        the post-processing).</li>
</ul>
<p>For this last analysis, the code assumes that
        the whole set of perturbations in a class has been calculated,
        either all the phonon perturbations or the homogeneous electric
        field perturbation, or both. If this is not true, the code
        will give results that may be wrong in the case that the
        reduced system of coordinates is not cartesian (for the dynamical
        matrix, the effective charge tensor of the dielectric matrix),
        or in all case wrong (the phonon frequencies); also the code
        will put zero in the matrix elements that have not been
        calculated. A Warning message is issued if the above information
        cannot be trusted.
<p>
Finally, the code provides the timing information.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a name="6.3"></a>6.3. The first-order wavefunction (1WF) files</b></p>
<p>
These are unformatted data
    files containing the planewaves coefficients of all the
    wavefunctions, written in the following format.
First, the header (see section <a href="help_abinit.html#header">6.4</a>
of the abinit help file), followed by
<pre>
 bantot=0                                    <-- counts over all bands
 index=0                                     <-- index for the wavefunctions
 do isppol=1,nsppol
  do ikpt=1,nkpt
   write(unit) npw1,nspinor,nband                    <-- for each k point
   write(unit) kg(1:3,1:npw1)                        <-- plane wave reduced coordinates
   do iband=1,nband1
    write(unit) (eigen1(jband+(iband-1)*nband+bantot),jband=1,2*nband)  <-- column of eigenvalue matrix
    write(unit) (cg(ii+index),ii=1,2*npw1*nspinor)   <-- wavefunction coefficients
   enddo                                            for a single band and k point
   bantot=bantot+nband
   index=index+2*npw1*nspinor*nband1
  enddo
 enddo
</pre>

<br>
    In this code section, npw1(ikpt) is the number of planewaves in the basis
    at the k+q point, nband1(ikpt) is likewise 
    the number of bands at the k point (which may vary among
    k points depending on occopt), and the factor of 2 in
    writing the wavefunction results from the fact that it is complex.
<br>
    eigen1 is the array that contains the matrix element
    of the first-order Hamiltonian between the different
    ground-state wavefunctions. It could be used to build
    the electron-phonon coupling and deformation potentials.
<br>
    Note that the format for first-order WF file
    differs from the format used for the ground-state WF file
    by the fact that eigen1 is now an array, and no more a vector,
    and is written with the corresponding wf, and no more
    before the writing of all wf for one k point.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a name="6.4"></a>6.4. The first-order density files</b></p>
<p>
    They consist of the header lines, followed by

<pre>
    write(unit) (rhor1(ir),ir=1,cplex*ngfft(1)*ngfft(2)*ngfft(3))
</pre>

<p>
    Here, rhor1 is the change of electron density in electrons/Bohr^3.
    The parameter cplex is 1 when q=0 and 2 when q/=0 . Indeed, for
    q=0, the density change is a real quantity, while it is complex
    in general when q/=0 .


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a name="6.5"></a>6.5. The derivative database (DDB)</b></p>
<p>
    It is made of two parts. The first should allow one to
    unambiguously identify the run that has generated the DDB,
    while the second part contains the 2DTE, grouped by blocks
    of data.

<p>
    Note that the DDB output of the ABINIT code
    can be merged with other DDBs as described in the Mrgddb
    help file.

<p>
    The first part contains :
<ul>
 <li>the DDB version number (that defines the
         structure of the DDB)</li>
 <li>seven parameters needed for the dimensionning of the DDB file
         (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#natom">natom</a>,
          <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#nkpt">nkpt</a>,

 <li>different information on the run that generated the 2DTE
         (acell,amu,ecut,iscf,ixc,kpt,kptnrm,
          ngfft,occ,rprim,sciss,symrel,xred,tnons,typat,tolwfr,wtk,zion,
          as well as information on the pseudopotentials by means
          of their Kleinman-Bylander energies). These values
          are simply a transcription of the input data, or other
          simple internal parameters.</li>
</ul>
Note : the format and content of this first part
of the DDBs have to be updated in the future ...

<p>
    The second part contains :
<ul>
 <li>the number of data blocks</li>
 <li>for each data block, the type of the block, its number of elements,
         and the list of elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The elements of a 2DTE block are described by 4 integers and
    2 real numbers. The 2 first integers define a first perturbation
    in the form (idir1,ipert1), the two next define a second
    perturbation in the form (idir2,ipert2). The matrix element
    corresponds to the derivative of the total energy with respect
    to the parameters corresponding to these perturbations.
    The real numbers are the real and imaginary parts of the 2DTE.
    Sometimes, the code uses spatial symmetries, the time-reversal
    symmetry, or even the permutation of first and second perturbations
    to deduce the value of non-computed matrix elements.
    This behaviour might be improved, as it is sometimes confusing ...

<h3><b>7. Numerical quality of the calculations</b></h3>
 <p>It is possible to get from the RF calculations essentially EXACT
derivatives of the total energy with respect to perturbations.
There is a published account of this fact in
<cite>Phys. Rev. A 52, 1096 (1995)</cite>.
An agreement of 8 digits or more was obtained in the comparison
with finite-difference derivatives of GS data.

<p>
The accuracy of these calculations are thus entirely determined
by the input parameters the user choose for the RF
run, and the preparatory GS runs.

<p>
We will now review the convergence parameters, usually the
same as for the GS calculations, indicating
only the specific features related to RF calculations.

<p>
Input parameters that could influence the accuracy
of the calculation are :
<ul>
 <li> <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>
        (the energy cut-off, that depends strongly on the pseudopotential)</li>
 <li> <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#ixc">ixc</a> (describing the exchange-correlation functional)</li>
 <li> <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#nkpt">nkpt</a>(or, more accurately,
       the Brillouin zone sampling, that can be determined alternatively
       by the inputs variables <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#ngkpt">ngkpt</a>
       or <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gstate.html#kptrlatt">kptrlatt</a>)</li>
 <li> one of the self-consistent convergence tolerance parameters,
      <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#toldfe">toldfe</a>,
      <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#tolvrs">tolvrs</a>, or
      <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#tolwfr">tolwfr</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The input parameters
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>,
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_rlx.html#ecutsm">ecutsm</a>,
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#ixc">ixc</a>,
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_dev.html#intxc">intxc</a>,
the set of k-wavevectors, as well as the related variables have to be the SAME in the
ground-state calculations that go before a RF run and this RF run.

<p>
Namely : do not try to use ground-state wavefunction
files produced with ecut=10Ha for a RF run with ecut=20Ha.
In some cases, the code will complain and stop,
but in other cases, it might simply produce garbage !

<p>
If the value of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a> is input by hand,
its value must also be equal in the
GS and RF cases. ALWAYS use <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>
large enough to have boxcut=2 or larger,
in order to avoid any FFT filter error. In the GS case, boxcut as small as
1.5 could be allowed in some cases. It is not allowed with RF calculations,
because they are more sensitive to that error.

<p>
The convergence tests with respect to
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>, and the k-point grid should
be done carefully. This was already emphasized in the abinit help
file and is re-emphasized here.
The user should test the convergence DIRECTLY on the property
he or she is interested in. For example, if the user wants a phonon frequency
accurate to 10 cm^-1, he/she could be lead to do a full calculation (GS+RF)
of phonons at 30Ha, then another full calculation
at 35Ha, then another at 40Ha...
It is an error to rely on tolerance on the total energy (for
example 1mHa/atom) or geometry (accuracy of one part per thousand on the
bond lengths) to draw 'a priori' conclusions on the convergence
of other quantities, and not monitor the convergence of these
directly. To be clear : if phonon frequencies are needed, check the
convergence of phonon frequencies !

<p>
The user should note that for bands with very small occupancy in the
metallic case as well as unoccupied bands for insulators, the ground
state run preceeding response function runs will not necessarily
converge these wavefunctions using usual ground-state tests such
as <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#toldfe">toldfe</a> or (better)
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#tolvrs">tolvrs</a>.  To be sure that inaccuracies are not
introduced into the response function calculation by poorly converged
unoccupied bands, a separate run starting from a saved charge density
(<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_files.html#prtden">prtden</a>=1 in the self-consistent run)
and using <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#iscf">iscf</a>=-2 and
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_basic.html#tolwfr">tolwfr</a>
may be needed.
