<h3><b><a name="1"></a>1. How to run the code </b></h3>


  <p><b><a name="intro1"></a>1.1. Introducing the files file.</b>
  <p>Given an input file (parameters described below) and the required pseudopotential
    files, the user must create a "files" file which lists names for the files
    the job will require, including the main input file, the main output file,
    root names for other input, output, or temporary files, and different pseudopotential
    file names.
  <p>The files file (called for example ab.files) could look like: </p>
  <p>
  <pre>
    ab_in
    ab_out
    abi
    abo
    tmp
    14si.psp
  </pre>
  <p>In this example:<br>
    - The main input file is called "ab_in". <br>
    - The main output will be put into the file called "ab_out". <br>
    - The name of input wavefunctions (if any) will be built from the root "abi"
    (namely abi_WFK, see later). <br>
    - The output wavefunctions will be written to abo_WFK. Other output files
    might be build from this root. <br>
    - The temporary files will have a name that use the root "tmp".
(for example tmp_STATUS).<br>
    - The pseudopotential needed for this job is "14si.psp". <br>
    <br>
    Other examples are given in the subdirectories of the ~abinit/tests directory. The maximal length
    of names for the main input or output files is presently 132 characters. It
    is 112 characters for the root strings, since they will be supplemented by
    different character strings.
  <p> <i>If you follow the tutorial, you should go back to the tutorial window now. </i>



  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
  <h4><a name="exec"></a>1.2. Running the code</h4>
  <p>The main executable file is called abinit. 
    Supposing that the "files" file is called ab.files,
    and that the executable is placed in your working directory, abinit is run
    interactively (in Unix) with the command
  <ul>
    <li><i>abinit < ab.files >& log </i></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  or, in the background, with the command
  <ul>
    <li><i>abinit < ab.files >& log & </i></li>
  </ul>
  <p> where standard out and standard error are piped to the log file called "log"
    (piping the standard error, thanks to the '&' sign placed after '>'
    is <b>really important</b> for the analysis of eventual failures, when not due
    to ABINIT, but to other sources, like disk full problem ...). The user can specify
    any names he/she wishes for any of these files. Variations of the above commands
    could be needed, depending on the flavor of UNIX that is used on the platform
    that is considered for running the code.

 <h3><b>2. The underlying theoretical framework and algorithms</b> </h3>

  <p>See the "<a href="../../bibliography/generated_files/bibliography.html">bibliography</a>" file.
  <p>The methods employed in this computer code to solve the electronic structure
    problem are described in part in different review papers as well as research
    papers. The code is an implementation of the Local Density Approximation to
    the Density Functional Theory, based upon a plane wave basis set and separable
    pseudopotentials. The iterative minimization algorithm is a combination of
    fixed potential preconditioned conjugate gradient optimization of wavefunction
    and a choice of different algorithms for the update of the potential, one
    of which is a potential-based conjugate gradient algorithm.
  <p>The representation of potential, density and wavefunctions in real space
    will be done on a regular 3D grid of points. Its spacing will be determined
    by the cut-off energy (see the input variable <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>)
    of the planewave basis in reciprocal space. This grid of points will also
    be the starting point of Fast Fourier Transforms between real and reciprocal
    space. The number of such points, called <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>,
    should be sufficiently large for adequate representation of the functions,
    but not too large, for reasons of computational efficiency. The trade-off between
    accuracy and computational efficiency is present in many places of the code,
    and addressed briefly at the end of the present help file.
  <p>We recommend a good introduction to many different concepts valid for this
    code, available in a Reviews of Modern Physics article, ``<cite>Iterative
    minimization techniques for ab initio total-energy calculations: molecular
    dynamics and conjugate gradients</cite>'', <cite>M. C. Payne, M. P. Teter,
    D. C. Allan, T. A. Arias, and J. D. Joannopoulos, Rev. Mod. Phys. 64, 1045-1097
    (1992)</cite>. <br>
    This paper does NOT reflect the present status of the code. ABINIT is closer
    in spirit to the paper of of Kresse and Furthmuller, see the 
   <a href="../../bibliography/generated_files/bibliography.html">bibliography</a> list.

 <h3><a name="3">&nbsp;</a>3. The input file </h3>


  <p><b><a name="intro3"></a>3.1. Format of the input file.</b></p>

  <p>Note that this input file was called ab_in in the example of
    <a href=#intro1> section 1.1</a> .<br>
    We first explain the content of the input file without use of the "multi-dataset"
    possibility (that will be explained in <a href=#multidataset>section 3.3</a>).

  <p> The parameters are input to the code from a single input file. Each parameter
    value is provided by giving the name of the input variable and then placing the
    numerical value(s) beside the name, separated by one or more spaces, or
    even an equal sign (equal signs are replaced by blanks by the parser). Depending
    on the input variable, the numerical value
    may be an integer or a real number (internal representation as double precision
    number), and may actually represent an array of values. If it represents an
    array, the next set of numbers separated by spaces are taken as the values
    for the array.
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do NOT separate a minus sign from the number to which it applies. </li>
    <li>Do NOT use tabs. </li>
    <li>NOTE THAT NO LINE OF THE INPUT FILE MAY EXCEED 132 CHARACTERS. That is,
      only the first 132 characters of each line of the input file will be read
      and parsed for input variables and their values. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The names of all the parameters can be found in the <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varset_allvars.html#">input variable database</a>.
    The list of input variables present in the latter file links them to their definitions,
    contained in different files, of which some are listed here:
<ul>
<li> Basic variables, <a href="#">[[FAKE LINK:varbas]]</a></li>
<li> Files handling variables, <a href="#">[[FAKE LINK:varfil]]</a></li>
<li> Ground-state calculation variables, <a href="#">[[FAKE LINK:vargs]]</a></li>
<li> GW variables, <a href="#">[[FAKE LINK:vargw]]</a></li>
<li> Parallelisation variables, <a href="#">[[FAKE LINK:varpar]]</a></li>
<li> Response Function variables, <a href="#">[[FAKE LINK:varrf]]</a></li>
</ul>
    In the actual input file, these parameters may be given in any desired order,
    and more than one may be given per line. Spaces are used to separate values
    and additional spaces are ignored. <br>
    An as example of input, the parameter for length scales is called
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a>
    and is an array <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a>(3) for
    the lengths of the primitive translations in Bohr atomic
    units. To input a typical Si diamond lattice one would have the line
    <p>
    <code>
    acell 10.25311 10.25311 10.25311</code>
    <p>in the input file. This may equivalently be written
    <p>
    <code>acell 3*10.25311</code>
    <p>
    and will still be parsed correctly : it is equivalent to the above line. Even<p>
    <code>
    acell *10.25311 </code>
    <p>will work. In the latter case the '*' sign means that the parser should use the given value to fill the array, by
    repeating it as many time as needed.
    <br>
    Multiple spaces are ignored, as is any text which does not contain the character
    strings which correspond to some input parameters. In case of arrays, only
    the needed numbers will be considered, and the eventual numbers after those
    needed will also be ignored. For example,
    <p>
    <code><a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#natom">natom</a> 3 # This gives
    the number of atoms <br>
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#typat">typat</a> 1 1 2 2 3 # typat(1:natom)
    gives the type of each atom : only <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    the first three data are read, since <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#natom">natom</a>=3
    </code><br>
    <p>
    A given variable is identified by the parser by having at least one blank
    before it and after it (again, multiple blanks are irrelevant). <br>
    ABINIT has also some (very limited) interpretor capabilities :
    <ul>
     <li>It can identify one slash sign (/) being placed between two numbers (without a separating blank)
         as being the definition of a fraction (e.g. 1/3 will be interpreted
         as 0.33333333333333d0) ; </li>
     <li>It can identify sqrt(...) or -sqrt(...) as being the definition of a square root,
         when applied to one valid number - also without a separating blank - (e.g. -sqrt(0.75) will be interpreted
         as -0.8660254038d0) ; </li>
     <li>Note, however, that these capabilities are NOT recursive. At most, a sqrt identifier can contain
         an expression that uses a fraction (e.g. sqrt(3/4) is OK), but two fractions (or two sqrt) cannot be used in one expression,
         and a sqrt cannot be present in the numerator or denominator of a fraction. </li>
    </ul>
    Comments should be placed to the right of
    the comment characters # or ! ; anything to the right of a "#" or a "!"
    on any line is simply ignored by the parser.
    Additional text, not preceded by a "#" or a "!" would not otherwise
    cause trouble unless the text inadvertently contained character
    strings which were the same as variable names
     (e.g. <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a>).
    The characters "#" or "!" can also be used to "store" old values
    of variables or place anything else of convenience into the file
    in such a way as to be
    ignored by the parser when the data is read. <br>
    Case is irrelevant as the entire input string is mapped to upper case before
    parsing, to remove case sensitivity. <br>
    More than one parameter per line may be given. If a given parameter name is
    given more than once in the input file, an error message is printed, and the
    code stops.

  <p><a name="parameters"></a><b>3.2. More about ABINIT input variables.</b></p>

  <p>In each section of the ABINIT input variables files,
    a generic information on the input variable is given :
    a mnemonics, some "characteristics",
    the variable type, and the default. Then, follows the description of the variable.
  <p>The <b>mnemonics</b> is indicated when available. </p>
  <p>The "characteristics" can be of different types : <b>DEVELOP</b>,
    <b>RESPFN</b>, <b>NONLINEAR</b>, <b>GW</b>, <b>BETHE_SALPETER</b>, <b>TDDFT</b>, <b>GEOMETRY_BUILDER</b>, <b>SYMMETRISER</b>,
    <b>SYMMETRY_FINDER</b>, <b>NO MULTI</b>, <b>INTERNAL_ONLY</b>, <b>INPUT_ONLY</b>, <b>EVOLVING</b>, <b>ENERGY</b>, <b>LENGTH</b>,
    <b>MAGNETIC FIELD</b>.
    We now explain each of these classes.
  <a name="DEVELOP"></a>
  <p> '<b>DEVELOP</b>' refers to input variables that are not used in production runs,
    but only during development time.
    For non developers, it is strongly advised to skip them. </p>
  <a name="RESPFN"></a>
  <a name="NONLINEAR"></a>
  <p>Some input variables are related to response function features, or non-linear features, and are indicated
    '<b>RESPFN</b>' and '<b>NONLINEAR</b>'. Detailed explanations related to response function  and non linear features
    are to be found in the complementary <a href="../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#">respfn help file</a>.
    The initials RF are used for 'response
    function', and non-response-function are often referred to as GS (for ground-state),
    although this latter designation is not really satisfactory. </p>
  <a name="GW"></a>
  <a name="BETHE_SALPETER"></a>
  <a name="TDDFT"></a>
  <p>Some input variables are related to excited state calculations, and are indicated
    '<b>GW</b>', '<b>BETHE_SALPETER</b>', or '<b>TDDFT</b>'. 
    No complementary help file is yet provided for such calculations. Please refer to the tutorial 
    (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_gw1.html#">lesson_gw1</a>, <a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_gw2.html#">lesson_gw2</a>, <a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_tddft.html#">lesson_tddft</a>, and <a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_bse.html#">lesson_bse</a>).
  <a name="GEOMETRY_BUILDER"></a>
  <p>There are also parameters related to the geometry builder, a preprocessor
    of the input file, aimed at easing the work of the user when there are molecules
    to be manipulated (rotation and translation), or group of atoms to be repeated.
    The indication '<b>GEOMETRY_BUILDER</b>' is given for them. These can also
    be skipped for the first few steps in the use of the code. <br>
    Indeed, it should be <i>easy to set up the geometry of systems with less than
    20-40 atoms without this geometry builder</i>. Even for larger systems, its
    functionalities could eventually be of no help. For a step-to-step description
    of this geometry builder, look at the variable '<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/geo.html#nobj">nobj</a>'.
    The related input variables being used for preprocessing of the input file, they are not echoed
    in the output file.
  </p>
  <a name="SYMMETRISER"></a>
  <p>Alternatively to the geometry builder, there is also a symmetriser. It allows
    to generate the full set of atoms in the primitive cell from the knowledge
    of the symmetry operations and the atoms in the asymmetric cell. It also allows
    to generate the symmetry operations from the knowledge of the number of the
    space group according to the international crystallographic tables. The indication
    '<b>SYMMETRISER</b>' is given for the variables related to its use. Look at
    the variable '<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/geo.html#spgroup">spgroup</a>'.
    <br>
    You may find in the space group <a href="../spacegrouphelpfile.html">help file</a>
    the crystallographic equivalence of the parameters belonging to the symmetriser.
    The related input variables being used for preprocessing of the input file, they are not echoed
    in the output file.</p>
  <a name="SYMMETRY_FINDER"></a>
  <p>Still as an alternative to the geometry builder and the symmetriser, if all
    the coordinates of the atoms are given, the code is able to deduce all symmetry
    operations leaving the lattice and atomic sublattices invariant, see '<b>SYMMETRY_FINDER</b>'. 
    Note that the default tolerance on the coordinates that are provided
    by the user, for a symmetry to be recognized, is on the order of 1.e-8 . If the
    provided coordinates are rather inaccurate, ABINIT will not recognize the symmetry,
    unless the input variable <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/geo.html#tolsym">tolsym</a>
    is changed.</p>
  <a name="NO_MULTI"></a>
  <p>Most of the variables can be used in the multi-dataset mode (see
    <a href=#multidataset>section 3.3</a>),
    but those that must have a unique value throughout all the
    datasets are signaled with the indication '<b>NO_MULTI</b>' </p>
  <a name="INPUT_ONLY"></a>
  <p>Some of the input variables, with characteristics '<b>INPUT_ONLY</b>' are only used by the parser, 
    to initialize other input variables, but are not
    transmitted inside the code, beyond the parser. In particular, they are not echoed in the output file.
  <a name="INTERNAL_ONLY"></a>
  <p>At variance, some internal variables, with characteristics '<b>INTERNAL_ONLY</b>' 
    are documented in the help files, but are not accessible as input variables. The documentation is provided
    because such variables are sometimes mentioned in the output file.
  <a name="EVOLVING"></a>
  <p>Most of the input variables do not change while a run is performed. Some
    of them, by contrast, may evolve, like the atomic positions, the atomic velocities,
    the cell shape, and the occupation numbers. Their echo, after the run has
    proceeded, will of course differ from their input value. They are signaled
    by the indication '<b>EVOLVING</b>'. </p>
  <a name="dimensions"></a>
  <a name="ENERGY"></a>
  <a name="LENGTH"></a>
  <a name="MAGNETIC_FIELD"></a>
  <p>The use of the atomic unit system (e.g. the Hartree for energy, about 27.211
    eV, and the Bohr for lengths about 0.529 Angstroms) is strictly
    enforced within the code. However, the dimension of some input variables
    can be specified and read correctly. At present, this applies to three types
    of variables : those that have the dimension of an energy, 
    those that have a dimension of length, and those that have a dimension of magnetic field.  
    The first class of variables
    have the characteristics '<b>ENERGY</b>', and can be specified
    in atomic units (Hartree), or electron-volts, or Rydbergs, or even Kelvin.
    The second class
    of variables have the characteristics '<b>LENGTH</b>', and can be
    specified in atomic units (Bohr) and angstrom.
    The third class of variables have the characteristics '<b>MAGNETIC FIELD</b>', and can be
    specified in atomic units and Tesla.

    The abinit parser recognize a dimension if it is specified after the
    list of numbers following the input variable keyword, in the input file.
    The specification can be upper or lower case, or a mix thereof.
    Here is the list of recognized chains of characters :
    <ul>
     <li> 'Ry ' => Rydberg (for energies) </li>
     <li> 'eV ' => electron-volts (for energies)  </li>
     <li> 'K ' => Kelvin (for energies)   </li>
     <li> 'Angstr...' => Angstrom (for lengths)  </li>
    </ul>
    Except in the case of 'Angstr', the abbreviation must be used (i.e. 'Rydberg'
    will not be recognized presently).
    Other character chains, like "au" (for atomic units) or "Hartree",
    or "Bohr" are not recognized,
    but make the parser choose (by default) atomic units, which is the correct behaviour.
    Example :
  <pre>
     acell 8 8 8 angstrom
     ecut 8 Ry
     tsmear 1000 K
  </pre>
   or
  <pre>
      acell 3*10 Bohr  ecut 270 eV  tsmear 0.01
  </pre>
    The use of the atomic units is mandatory for other dimensioned input variables, like
    the tolerance on forces (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#toldff">toldff</a>),
    parameters that define an 'object' (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/vargeo.html#objaax" target="kwimg">objaax, objbax</a>, 
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/vargeo.html#objatr" target="kwimg">objatr, objbtr</a>),
    and the initial velocity of atoms (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#vel">vel</a>
    - if needed). </p>
  <p>The initial atomic positions can be input in Bohr or Angstrom through '<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#xcart">xcart</a>',
    but also, independently, in Angstrom through '<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#xangst">xangst</a>',
    or even in reduced coordinates, through '<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#xred">xred</a>'.
    Reduced cartesian coordinates must be used for the eventual translations accompanying
    symmetry operations (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#tnons">tnons</a>).
  </p>

  <p><a name="chkexit">In addition to giving the input variables</a>,
     the input file can be useful
     for another purpose : placing the word "<b>exit</b>" on the top line
     will cause the job to
     end smoothly on the very next iteration, if the
     <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#chkexit">chkexit</a> input variable is non-zero.  This functions because
     the program closes and reopens the input file on every iteration
     and checks the top line for the keyword "exit".  THE WORD MUST BE
     PLACED WITH SPACES (BLANKS) ON BOTH SIDES.  Thus placing exit on the top
     line of the input file WHILE THE JOB IS ALREADY RUNNING will force
     the job to end smoothly on the very next iteration.
     On some machines, this does not work always (we do not know why...).
     Another possibility is offered :
     one can create a file named "abinit.exit" in the directory where
     the job was started. The code should also smoothly end.
     In both cases, the stop is not immediate. It can take a significant
     fraction (about 20% at most) of one SCF step to execute properly the
     instruction still needed.

  <p><b><a name="multidataset"></a>3.3. The multi-dataset mode.</b>
  <p>Until now, we have assumed that the user wants to make computations corresponding
    to one set of data : for example, determination of the total energy for some
    geometry, with some set of plane waves and some set of k-points. </p>
  <p>It is often needed to redo the calculations for different values of some
    parameter, letting all the other things equal. As typical examples, we have
    convergence studies needed to determine which cut-off energy gives the needed
    accuracy. In other cases, one makes chains of calculations in order to compute
    the band structure : first a self-consistent calculation of the density and
    potential, then the eigenenergy computation along different lines. </p>
  <p>For that purpose, the <b>multi-dataset mode</b> has been implemented. </p>
  <p>It allows the code to treat, in one run, different sets of data, and to chain
    them. The number of datasets to be treated is specified by the variable
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ndtset">ndtset</a>,
    while the indices of the datasets (by default 1, 2, 3,
    and so on) can be eventually provided by the array <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#jdtset">jdtset</a>.
  </p>
  <p>For each dataset to be treated, characterized by some index, each input variable
    will determined by the following <b>rules</b> (actually, it is easier to understand
    when one looks at examples, see below) : </p>
  <ul>
    <li> (<a name="ref8_1"></a>1) ABINIT looks whether the variable name (e.g.
      <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a> ), appended with the
      index of the dataset (e.g. <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#jdtset">jdtset</a>=2),
      exists (e.g. "ecut2" ) . It
      will take the data that follows this keyword, if it exists.</li>
    <li> (<a name="ref8_2"></a>2) If this modified variable name does not exist,
      it will look whether a metacharacter, a series or a double-loop data set
      has been defined, see sections
      <a href=#series>3.4</a> or <a href=#loop>3.5</a>.</li>
    <li> (<a name="ref8_3"></a>3) If the variable name appended with the index
      of the dataset does not exist, and if there is no series nor double-loop
      dataset for this keyword, it looks for an occurrence of the variable name
      without any index appended, and take the corresponding data. (This corresponds
      to the single dataset mode)</li>
    <li> (<a name="ref8_4"></a>4) If such occurrences do not exist, it takes the
      default value. (Also, similar to the single dataset mode)</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
     ---------------

     1st example.

     ndtset   2
      acell   8 8 8
       ecut1  10
       ecut2  15
</pre>
  means that there are 2 datasets : a first in which
  <pre>     acell 8 8 8  ecut 10 </pre>
  has to be used, and a second in which
  <pre>     acell 8 8 8  ecut 15</pre>
  has to be used.
  <pre>
     ------------------

     2nd example

     ndtset 2     jdtset 4 5

     acell   8 8 8
     acell5 10 10 10
     ecut1  10
     ecut2  15
     ecut3  20
     ecut4  25
     ecut5  30
</pre>
  <p>this means that there are still two datasets, but now characterized by the
    indices 4 and 5, so that the first run will use the generic "acell",
    and "ecut4" :
  <pre>     acell 8 8 8 ecut 25
</pre>
  and the second run will use "acell5"
  and "ecut5" :
  <pre>     acell 10 10 10 ecut 30 </pre>
  <p>Note that ecut1, ecut2 and ecut3 are not used. </p>
  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4><a name="series"></a>3.4. Defining a series. </h4>

Rule (2) is split in three parts : (2a), (2b) and (2c).
<br> Series relate with (2b):
<p>
(<a name="ref8_2b"></a>2b) If the variable name appended with the index of the
dataset does not exist, the code looks whether a series has been defined for this
keyword.
<p>There are two kinds of series :
<ul>
    <li>arithmetic series (constant <i>increment</i> between terms of the series)
    <li> geometric series (constant <i>ratio</i> between terms of the series)
  </ul>
  <p>The first term of the series is defined by the keyword appended with a colon
    (e.g. <b>ecut:</b> ), while the increment of an arithmetic series is defined
    by the keyword appended with a plus (e.g. <b>ecut+</b> ), and the factor of
    a geometric series is defined by the keyword appended with a times (e.g. <b>ecut*</b>
    ). </p>
  <p>If the index of the dataset is 1, the first term of the series is used, while
    for index N , the appropriate input data is obtained by considering the Nth
    term of the series. </p>
  <pre>

  3rd example

    ecut1 10
    ecut2 15
    ecut3 20
    ecut4 25
    ecut5 30
    ecut6 35
</pre>
  is equivalent to
  <pre>    ndtset 6 ecut: 10 ecut+ 5
</pre>
  <p>In both cases, there are six datasets, with increasing values of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>&nbsp; </h4>

<h4><a name="loop"></a>3.5. Defining a double loop dataset </h4>
  <p>To define a double loop dataset, one has first to define the upper limit
    of two loop counters, thanks to the variable <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>.
    The inner loop will execute from 1 to <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>(2),
    and the outer loop will execute from 1 to <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>(1).
    Note that the largest value for <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>(1) is presently 999,
    while it is 9 for <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>(2) (so, only the last digit for the inner loop). </p>
  <p>The value of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ndtset">ndtset</a> must
    be coherent with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a> (it
    must equal the product <code>udtset(1)*udtset(2)</code> ). </p>
  <p>A dataset index is created by the concatenation of the outer loop index and
    the inner loop index. <br>
    For example, if <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>(1)
    is 2 and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>(2) is 4,
    the index will assume the following values : <code>11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22,
    23, and 24</code>.
  <p> Independently of the use of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#udtset">udtset</a>,
    rules (2a) and (2c) will be used to define the value of an input variable: </p>
  <p><a name="ref8_2a"></a>(2a) The question mark "<b>?</b>" can be used as a
    metacharacter, replacing any digit from 1 to 9, to define an index of a dataset.
    <br>
    For example, <b>ecut?</b>1 means that the input value that follows it can
    be used for <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a> for the datasets
    <code>01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, and 91</code>. </p>
  <p><a name="ref8_2c"></a>(2c) If the variable name appended with the index of
    the dataset does not exist, the code looks whether a double-loop series has
    been defined for this keyword. Series can be defined for the inner loop index
    or the outer loop index. Two signs will be appended to the variable name (instead
    of one in the simple series case). One of these signs must be a question mark
    "<b>?</b>", again used as a metacharacter able to assume the values 1 to 9.<br>
    If it is found in the first of the two positions, it means that the series
    does not care about the outer loop index (so the values generated are equal
    for all outer loop index values). If it is found in the second of the two
    positions, the series does not care about the inner loop index. The other
    sign can be a colon, a plus or a times, as in the case of the series defined
    in <a href="#ref8_2a">(2a)</a>, with the same meaning. </p>
  <p>Rule (<a href="#ref8_1">1</a>) has precedence over them,
    they have precedence over rules (<a href="#ref8_3">3</a>) or
    (<a href="#ref8_4">4</a>), rule (<a href="#ref8_2a">2a</a>)
    has precedence over rules <a href="#ref8_2b">(2b)</a> or <a href="#ref8_2c">(2c)</a>
    and the two latter cannot be used simultaneously for the same variable. </p>

  <p>Note: <i>This "files" file is called ab.files in
  <a href=#intro1>section 1.1</a> .</i>
  </p>
  <p>Contains the file names or root names needed to build file names.
    These are listed below : there are 5 names or root names for input,
    output and temporaries, and then a list of pseudopotentials.
    These names may be provided from unit 05 interactively during the run but
    are more typically provided by piping from a file in Unix (the "files" file). </p>
  <p> <b>ab_in</b> <br>
    Filename of file containing the input data, described in the preceding sections.
  <p><b>ab_out</b><br>
    Filename of the main file in which formatted output will be placed (the main output file).
    Error messages
    and other diagnostics will NOT be placed in this file, but sent to unit 06
    (terminal or log file); the unit 06 output can be ignored unless something
    goes wrong. The code repeats a lot of information to both unit 06 and to the
    main output file. The unit 06 output is intended to be discarded if the run
    completes successfully, with the main output file keeping the record of the
    run in a nicer looking format.
  <p><b>abi</b> <br>
    The other files READ by the code will have a name that is constructed from
    the root "abi". This apply to optionally read wavefunction, density or potential
    files. In the multi-dataset mode, this root will be complemented by<a name="ds"></a>
    '<b>_DS</b>' and the dataset index. The list of possible input files, with
    their name created from the root 'abi', is the following (a similar list exist
    when '<b>_DS</b>' and the dataset index are appended to 'abi'):
  <ul>
    <li>

    at giving each of these files a different name. It is attributed as follows:<br>
    - case ionmov==1 : there is an initialization phase, that takes 4 calls
    to the SCF calculation. The value of x will be A, B, C, and D. Then, x will
    be 1, 2, 3 ... , actually in agreement with the value of itime (see the keyword
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#ntime">ntime</a>) <br>
    - other ionmov cases : the initialisation phase take only one SCF call.
    The value of x will be 0 for that call. Then, the value of x is 1, 2, 3 ...
    in agreement with the value of itime (see the keyword <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#ntime">ntime</a>)
  </p>
  <p><b>tmp</b> <br>
    The temporary files created by the codes will have a name that is constructed
    from the root "<b>tmp</b>". tmp should usually be chosen such as to give access
    to a disk of the machine that is running the job, not a remote (NFS) disk.
    Under Unix, the name might be something like <code>/tmp/user_name/temp</code>.
    As an example, <b>tmp_STATUS</b> <br>
      gives the status of advancement of the calculation, and is updated very
      frequently </p>
  <p><b>psp1</b> <br>
    filename of first pseudopotential input file. The pseudopotential data files
    are formatted. There must be as many filenames provided sequentially here
    as there are types of atoms in the system, and the order in which the names
    are given establishes the identity of the atoms in the unit cell. (psp2, psp3,
    ... )

  <h3><b>6. The different output files</b></h3>
  <p>Explanation of the output from the code
  <p>Output from the code goes to several places listed below.
  <p>&nbsp;


  <p><b><a name="logfile"></a>6.1. The log file</b> </p>
  <p>The "log" file (this is the standard UNIX output file, and corresponds to
    Fortran unit number 06) : a file which echoes the values of the input parameters
    and describes various steps of the calculation, typically in much more detail
    than is desired as a permanent record of the run. This log file is intended
    to be informative in case of an error or for a fuller description of the run.
    For a successful run the user will generally delete the log file afterwards.
    There are four types of exception messages : <b>ERROR</b>, <b>BUG</b>, <b>WARNING</b>
    and <b>COMMENT</b> messages. </p>
  <p><b>ERROR</b> and <b>BUG</b> messages cause the code to stop, immediately,
    or after a very small delay. An <b>ERROR</b> is attributed to the user, while
    a <b>BUG</b> is attributed to the developer. </p>
  <p>A <b>WARNING</b> message indicates that something happened that is not as
    expected, but this something is not so important as to make the code stop.
    A <b>COMMENT</b> message gives some information to the user, concerning something
    unusual. None of them should appear when the run is completely normal.
    <p>
    After a run is completed, always have a look at the end of the log file, to
    see whether an <b>ERROR</b> or a <b>BUG</b> occurred. <br>
    <p> Also, the code gives the number of <b>WARNING</b> or <b>COMMENT</b> it issued.
    It is advised to read at least the <b>WARNING</b> messages, during the
    first month of ABINIT use. </p>

  <p> <i>If you follow the tutorial, you should go back to the tutorial window now. </i>



  <p>&nbsp;
  <p><a name="outputfile"></a><b>6.2. The main output file </b>
  <p>The <b>main output file</b> is a formatted output file to be kept as the permanent
    record of the run. </p>
  <p>Note that it is expected <b>not</b> to exist at the beginning of the run:
    <br>
    If a file with the name specified in the "files" file already exists, the
    code will generate, from the given one, another name, appended with <b>.A</b>
    . If this new name already exists, it will try to append <b>.B</b> , and so
    on, until <b>.Z</b> . <br>
    Then, the code stops, and asks you to clean the directory. </p>
  <p>The <b>main output file</b> starts with a heading:
  <ul>
    <li>version number and specified platform
    <li>copyright notice and distribution licence
    <li>date
    <li>echo of "files" file (except pseudopotential name)
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>Then, for each dataset, it reports the point symmetry group and Bravais lattice,
    and the expected memory needs. It echoes
    the input data, and report on checks of data consistency for each dataset. </p>
  <p> <i>If you follow the tutorial, you should go back to the tutorial window now. </i>

  <p>&nbsp;

<p><b><a name="6.3"></a>6.3. More on the main output file </b></p>
  <p> Then, for each dataset, the real computation is done, and the code will
    report on some initialisations, the SCF convergence, and the final analysis of
    results for this dataset. Each of these phases is now described in more details.
    <p>
    The code reports:
  <ul>
    <li>the real and reciprocal space translation vectors (<i>Note</i>: the definition
      of the reciprocal vector is such that R<sub>i</sub>.G<sub>j</sub>=
      delta<sub>ij</sub>)</li>
    <li>the volume of the unit cell</li>
    <li>the ratio between linear dimension of the FFT box and the sphere of plane
      waves, called "<b>boxcut</b>". <br>
      It must be above 2 for exact treatment of convolutions by FFT.
      <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>
      has been automatically chosen to give a boxcut value larger than 2, but
      not much larger, since more CPU time is needed for larger FFT grids; </li>
    <li> the code also mention that for the same FFT grid you might treat (slightly)
      larger <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>
      (so, with a rather small increase of CPU time) </li>
    <li>the heading for each pseudopotential which has been input
    <li>from the inwffil subroutine, a description of the wavefunction initialization
      (random number initialization
      or input from a disk file), that is, a report of the number of planewaves
      (npw) in the basis at each k point</li>
    <li>from the setup2 subroutine, the average number of planewaves over all k points
      is reported in two forms, arithmetic average and geometric average. </li>
  </ul>
  Until here, the output of a ground-state computation is identical
  to the one of a response-function calculation.
  See the <a href="../../users/generated_files/help_respfn.html#">respfn help file</a> for the latter,
  especially section <a href="help_respfn.html#6.2">6.2</a>.
  <p>
  Next the code reports information for each SCF iteration:
  <ul>
    <li>the iteration number
    <li>the (pseudo) total energy (Etot) in Hartree [This is not the total energy of the system, since the pseudopotential approximation has been made : a constant energy (in the frozen-core approximation) should be added to the present pseudo total energy in order to obtain a total energy, that includes the contributions from the core electrons. Since only differences of total energy matter (except is extremely rare cases), one can work with this pseudo energy like if it were the true total energy, except that the missing constant depends on the pseudopotential that has been used. Thus one has to perform differences of pseudo energies between simulations that use the same pseudopotentials].
    <li>the change in Etot since last iteration (deltaE)
    <li> the maximum squared residual residm over all bands and k points (residm
      - the residual measures the quality of the wavefunction convergence)
    <li>the squared residual of the potential in the SCF procedure (vres2)
    <li>the maximum change in the gradients of Etot with respect to fractional
      coordinates (diffor, in Hartree)
    <li> the rms value of the gradients of Etot with respect to fractional coordinates
      (maxfor, in Hartree).<br>
      <i>The latter two are directly related to forces on each atom.</i>
    <li>Then comes an assessment of the SCF convergence : the criterion for fulfillment
      of the SCF criterion (defined by <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#toldfe">toldfe</a>,
      <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#toldff">toldff</a>, <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#tolwfr">tolwfr</a>
      or <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#tolvrs">tolvrs</a>) might be satisfied
      or not ...
    <li>Then the stresses are reported.
  </ul>
  <p>This ends the content of a fixed atomic position calculation. </p>
  <p>Many such blocks can follow. </p>
  <p>When the atomic positions have been eventually relaxed, according to the
    value of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#ntime">ntime</a>, the code output
    more information:
  <ul>
    <li>The squared residuals for each band are reported, k point by k point.
    <li> Then the fractional or reduced coordinates are given,
    <li>followed by the energy gradients,
    <li>followed by the cartesian coordinates in Angstroms,
    <li>followed by the cartesian forces in Hartree/Bohr and eV/Angstrom.
    <li>Also are given the rms force (<b>frms</b>) and the maximum absolute value
      of any force component (<b>max</b>).
    <li>Next are the length scales of the unit cell in Bohr and in Angstroms.
    <li>Next are the eigenvalues of each band for each k point, in eV or Hartree
      or both depending on the choice of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#enunit">enunit</a>. <br>
      <a name="averagepot"> NOTE </a>
      that the average electrostatic potential of a periodically repeated
      cell is UNDEFINED. <br>
      In the present implementation, the average Hartree potential and local potential are imposed
      to be zero, but not the average exchange-correlation potential.
      This definition gives some meaning to
      the absolute values of eigenenergies, thanks to Janak's theorem: they
      are derivatives of the total energy with respect to occupation number.
      Indeed, the G=0 contributions of the Hartree, local potential and ion-ion
      to the total energy is independent of the occupation number
      in the present implementation.
      With this noticeable exception, one should always work with <b>differences</b>
      in eigenenergies, as well as <b>differences</b> between eigenenergies and the potential.
      For example, the absolute eigenenergies of a bulk cell should not be used
      to try to predict a work function. The latter quantity should be obtained
      in a supercell geometry, by comparing the Fermi energy in a slab and the potential
      in the vacuum in the same supercell.
    <li>Next are the minimum and maximum values for charge density, and next smaller
      or larger values (in order to see degeneracies).
    <li>Next are the total energy (Ha and eV) and its components:
      <ul>
        <li> kinetic,
        <li>Hartree,
        <li>exchange and correlation (xc),
        <li>Ewald (ion-ion energy),
        <li>"<i>core correction</i>" to the local pseudopotential,
        <li>local pseudopotential, and
        <li>nonlocal pseudopotential.
      </ul>
      The sum of the Kohn-Sham energies (termed "band energy") is also given.
    <li>Next is the stress tensor, <br>
      (1/ucvol) d(Etot)/d(strain(a,b)) <br>
      for Etot=total energy per unit cell and <br>
      <b>a</b>,<b>b</b> are <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, or <b>z</b> components of strain.
      <br>
      The stress tensor is given in cartesian coordinates in Hartree/Bohr<sup>3</sup> and GPa.
      <br>
      The basics of the stress tensor are described in O. H. Nielsen and Richard
      M. Martin, see the <a href="../../bibliography/generated_files/bibliography.html" target="filesimg">bibliography</a>
      file.
  </ul>
  <p>Having finished all the calculations for the different datasets, the code
    echoes the parameters listed in the input file, using the latest values e.g.
    for <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#xred">xred</a>, <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#vel">vel</a>,
    and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#xcart">xcart</a>, and supplement
    them with the values obtained for the total energy, the forces and stresses,
    as well as occupation numbers. <br>
    The latter echoes are very convenient for a quick look at the result of calculation
    ! </p>
  <p>This is followed finally by the timing output: both "cpu"
    time and "wall clock" time as provided by calls within the code. <br>
    The total cpu and wall clock
    times are reported first, in seconds, minutes, and hours for convenient checking
    at a glance. <br>
    Next are the cpu and wall times
    for the principal time-consuming subroutine calls, each of which is independent
    of the others. The sum of these times usually accounts for about 90% of the
    run time.<br>
    The main subroutines, for BIG jobs, are
  <ul>
    <li>(1) fourwf: the subroutine which performs the fast Fourier transform for
      the wavefunctions:
    <li> (2) fourdp: the subroutine which performs the fast Fourier transform
      related to density and potential
    <li>(3) rhohxc: computes the Hartree and exchange-correlation energy and potential
      and sometimes derivative of potential; only the XC timing is reported, excluding
      time connected to the FFTs : <code>xc:pot/=fourdp.</code>
    <li>(4) nonlop: computes
      <pre>< G | V<sub>non-local</sub> | C ></pre>
      the matrix elements of the nonlocal pseudopotential;
    <li>(5) projbd: Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation
  </ul>
  <p>In case of small jobs, other (initialisation) routines may take a larger
    share, and the sum of the times for the principal time-consuming subroutine
    calls will not make 90% of the run time.. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>If the long printing option has been selected (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/files.html#prtvol">prtvol</a>=1),
    the code gives much more information in the whole output file. These should
    be rather self-explanatory, usually. Some need more explanation. <br>
    In particular the cpu and wall times for major subroutines which are NOT independent
    of each other; for example vtorho conducts the loop over k points and calls
    practically everything else. In case of a ground state calculation, at fixed
    atomic positions, these subroutines are
  <ul>
    <li> (1) <b>abinit</b>: the main routine
    <li> (2) <b>driver</b> : select ground state or response calculations
    <li> (3) <b>gstate</b> : the driver of the ground state calculations
    <li> (4) <b>scfcv</b> : the SCF cycle driver
    <li> (5) <b>vtorho</b> : compute the density from the potential (it includes
      a loop over spins and k-points)
    <li> (6) <b>vtowfk</b> : compute the wavefunctions at one particular k-point
      (includes a non self consistent loop, and a loop over bands)
    <li> (7) <b>cgwf</b> : optimize one wavefunction in a fixed potential
    <li> (8) <b>getghc</b>: computes < G | H | C >, that is, applies the Hamiltonian
      operator to an input vector.
  </ul>

  <b><a name="header"></a>6.4. The header</b>
  <p>The <b>wavefunction files</b>, <b>density files</b>, and
    <b>potential files</b> all begin with the same records, called the "header". <br>
    This header is treated using a hdr_type datastructure inside ABINIT. There
    are dedicated routines inside ABINIT for initializing a header, updating
    it, reading the header of an unformatted disk file, writing a header to an

  <b><a name="densoutputfile"></a>6.5. The density output file</b>
  <p>This is an unformatted data file containing the electron density on the real
    space FFT grid. It consists of the header records followed by
  <pre>
do ispden=1,nspden
 write(unit) (rhor(ir),ir=1,cplex*ngfft(1)*ngfft(2)*ngfft(3))
enddo
</pre>
  where <b>rhor</b> is the electron density in electrons/Bohr^3, and cplex
  is the number of complex components of the density (cplex=1 for
  GS calculations -the density is real-, and cplex=1 or 2 for RF).
  The input variable <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#nspden">nspden</a>
  describes the number of components of the density.
  The first component (the only one present when
  <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#nspden">nspden</a>=1) is always the total
  charge density. When
  <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#nspden">nspden</a>=2, the second
  component is the density associated with spin-up electrons. When
  <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#nspden">nspden</a>=4, the
  second, third and fourth components correspond to the x, y and z projections
  of the local magnetization, in units of hbar/2 .
  Note that the meaning of the different components
  of the density differs for the density array (rhor) and for the
  different potential arrays (vxc ...), see section <a href=#localpotfile> 6.6 </a>.
  <p>To identify the points in real space which correspond with the index "ir"
    above, consider the following. <br>
    The first array value (ir=1) corresponds with the first grid point which is
    at the origin of the unit cell, (x=0, y=0, z=0). <br>
    The next grid point (ir=2) lies along the first primitive translation at the
    next fft grid point, which is (1/<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1))*<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a>(1)*<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#rprim">rprim</a>(mu,1).
    This is 1/<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1) of the
    way along the first primitive translation. <br>
    The rest of the values up to ir=<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)
    lie along this vector, at (ir-1)/<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)
    of the way along the first primitive translation. The point at ir=<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)+1
    lies at 1/<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(2) along the
    second primitive translation. <br>
    The next points up to ir=<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)+<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)
    are displaced in the direction of the second primitive translation by 1/<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(2)
    and in the first translation by (ir-<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)-1)/<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1).
    <br>
    This pattern continues until ir=<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)*<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(2).
    <br>
    The next point after that is displaced along the third primitive translation
    by 1/ngfft(3), and so forth until ir varies all the way from 1 to <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1)*<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(2)*<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(3).
    This last point is in the corner diagonally opposite from the origin, or right
    alongside the origin if the whole grid is viewed as being periodically repeated.

    The underlying grid is as described above.
    If <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#nspden">nspden</a>=2, the

    the components correspond to the up-up potential, the down-down potential,
    the real part of the up-down potential, and the imaginary part of the up-down potential.
    Note that the Hartree potential is NOT spin-dependent, but in order
    to use the same format as for the other potential files, the

  <p><b><a name="wavefctfile"></a>6.7. The wavefunction output file  </b>
  <p>This is an unformatted data file containing the planewaves coefficients of
    all the wavefunctions, and different supplementary data.
  <p>The <b>ground-state</b> wf file consists
    of the header records,
    and data written with the following lines of FORTRAN (version 4.0 and more recent versions):

       enddo
</pre>
  <p> If the job ended without problem, a few supplementary lines are added, 
    in order to give the history of atomic positions
    and corresponding forces. The integer nxfh gives the number of pairs (x,f)
    of positions and forces in reduced coordinates :

 enddo
</pre>
  The dummy variables might contain, in the future, the description of the unit
  cell, and the stresses.
  The type of the different variables is :
  <pre>

while the planewave coordinate record was not present (in both GS and RF cases).

<p> Note that there is an alternative format (_KSS) for the output

  <p><b><a name="parallel_case"></a>6.9. Control of output in the parallel case.</b>

  <p>For massively parallel runs, one cannot afford to have some of the output files that are usually created. Explicitly,
  the log file and also the status file become problematic. By default, with less than N processors, they are created, but beyond N processors, 
  they are deactivated except for the main log file (master processor).
  <p>This default behaviour can be changed as follows. 
If a file named "_NOLOG" exists in the current directory, then no log file and no status file will be created, even with less than N processors. 

By contrast, if a file "_LOG" exists in the current directory, then a log file and the status files will be created, even with more than N processors.
Alternatively, if a file named "_MAINLOG" exists and there are less than N processors, only the master processor writes the log and status files (this mimic the default behavior when using more than N processors but with less than N processors)
  <p>In ABINITv7, N was set at N=100. However, with ABINITv8, N has been switched to 2. 
It can be changed "by hand", though : modify NPROC_NO_EXTRA_LOG in src/10_defs/defs_basis.F90 and recompile. 
See src/95_drive/iofn1.F90 for more explanation.

  </ul>
  <br>
  The technical design of the pseudopotential also affects the quality of the
  results.


  <p><a name="ref11_1"></a>(1) The first issue regarding convergence is the number
    of planewaves in the basis for a given set of atoms. Some atoms (notably those
    in the first row or first transition series row) have relatively deep pseudopotentials
    which require many planewaves for convergence. In contrast are atoms like
    Si for which fewer planewaves are needed. A typical value of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>
    for silicon might be 5-10 Hartree for quite good convergence, while the value
    for oxygen might be 25-35 Hartree or more depending on the convergence desired
    and the design of the pseudo- potential.
  <p>NOTE: It is necessary in every new problem to <b>TEST</b> the convergence
    by <b>RAISING</b> <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a> for
    a given calculation until the results being computed are constant to within
    some tolerance. This is up to the user and is very important. For a given
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a> and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#rprim">rprim</a>,
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a> is the parameter which
    controls the number of planewaves. Of course if <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#rprim">rprim</a>
    or <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a> is varied then the
    number of planewaves will also change.
  <p>Let us reiterate that extremely careful pseudopotential design can optimize
    the convergence of <i>e.g.</i> the total energy within some range of planewave
    number or <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>. It is appropriate
    to attempt to optimize this convergence, especially for difficult atoms like
    oxygen or copper, as long as one does not significantly compromise the quality
    or transferability of the pseudopotential. There are many people working on
    new techniques for optimizing convergence.
  <p>For information on extended norm conservation, see <cite>E. L. Shirley, D.
    C. Allan, R. M. Martin, and J. D. Joannopoulos, Phys. Rev. B 40, 3652 (1989)</cite>.
  <p>For information on optimizing the convergence of pseudopotentials, see <cite>A.
    M. Rappe, K. M. Rabe, E. Kaxiras, and J. D. Joannopoulos, Phys. Rev. B 41,
    1227 (1990)</cite>.


  <p><a name="ref11_2"></a>(2) In addition to achieving convergence in the number
    of planewaves in the basis, one must ensure that the SCF iterations which
    solve the electronic structure for a given set of atomic coordinates are also
    converged. This convergence is controlled by the parameters <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#toldfe">toldfe</a>,
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#toldff">toldff</a>, <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#tolwfr">tolwfr</a>,
    and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#tolvrs">tolvrs</a>, as well as the
    parameter <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#nstep">nstep</a>. One of the
    "tolerance" parameters must be chosen, and, when the required level of tolerance
    is fulfilled, the SCF cycles will stop. The <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#nstep">nstep</a>
    variable also controls convergence in preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations
    by forcing the calculation to stop whenever the number of such iterations
    exceeds nstep. Usually one wants nstep to be set larger than needed to reach
    a given tolerance, or else one wants to restart insufficiently converged calculations
    until the required tolerance is reached.
  <p>Note that, if the gap in the system closes (e.g. due to defect formation
    or if the system is metallic in the first place), the presently coded algorithm
    will be slower to converge than for insulating materials. Convergence trouble
    during iterations usually signals closure of the gap. The code will suggest
    to treat at least one unoccupied state (or band) in order to be able to monitor
    such a closure.


  <p><a name="ref11_3"></a>(3) For self consistent calculations (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#iscf">iscf</a>
    positive) it is important to test the adequacy of the k point integration.
    If symmetry is used then one usually tests a set of "special point" grids.
    Otherwise one tests the addition of more and more k points, presumably on
    uniform grids, to ensure that a sufficient number has been included for good
    k point integration. The parameter nkpt indicates how many k points are being
    used, and their coordinates are given by kpt and kptnrm, described above.
    The weight given to each k point is provided by input variable <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#wtk">wtk</a>.
    Systematic tests of k point integration are much more difficult than tests
    of the adequacy of the number of planewaves. The difficulty I refer to is
    simply the lack of a very systematic method for generating k point grids for
    tests.
  <p><a name="ref11_4"></a>(4) It is possible to run calculations for which the
    fft box is not quite large enough to avoid aliasing error in fft convolutions.
    An aliasing error, or a Fourier filter approximation, is occurring when the
    output variable "<b>boxcut</b>" is less than 2. boxcut is the smallest ratio
    of the fft box side to the planewave basis sphere diameter. If this ratio
    is 2 or larger then e.g. the calculation of the Hartree potential from the
    charge density is done without approximation. <br>
    NOTE : the values of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1:3)
    are chosen automatically by the code to give boxcut > 2, if <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>
    has not been set by hand. At ratios smaller than 2, certain of the highest
    Fourier components are corrupted in the convolution. If the basis is nearly
    complete, this Fourier filter can be an excellent approximation. In this case
    values of boxcut can be as small as about 1.5 without incurring significant
    error. For a given <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#ecut">ecut</a>, <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a>,
    and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#rprim">rprim</a>, one should run
    tests for which <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a> is large
    enough to give boxcut >= 2, and then one may try smaller values of <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/gstate.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>
    if the results are not significantly altered. See the descriptions of these
    variables above.
  <p><a name="ref11_5"></a>(5) If you are running calculations to relax or equilibrate
    structures, i.e. with <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#ionmov">ionmov</a>=1
    and possibly <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#vis">vis</a>>0, then the
    quality of your molecular dynamics or relaxation will be affected by the parameters
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#amu">amu</a>, <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#dtion">dtion</a>,
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#vis">vis</a>, <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#ntime">ntime</a>,
    <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#tolmxf">tolmxf</a>. Clearly if you want
    a relaxed structure you must either run long enough or make repeated runs
    until the largest force in the problem (output as fmax) is smaller than what
    you will tolerate (see <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#tolmxf">tolmxf</a>).
    <br>
    If <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#dtion">dtion</a> is too large for
    the given values of masses (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#amu">amu</a>)
    and viscosity (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#vis">vis</a>) then the
    molecular dynamics will be unstable. If <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#dtion">dtion</a>
    is too small, then the molecular dynamics will move inefficiently slowly.
    A consensus exists in the community that forces larger than about 0.1 eV/Angstrom
    are really too large to consider the relaxation to be converged. It is best
    for the user to get experience with this in his/her own application. <br>
    The option <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/rlx.html#ionmov">ionmov</a>=2, 3 or
    7 are also available This uses the Broyden (BFGS) scheme for structural optimization
    and is much more efficient than viscous damping for structural relaxation.
  <p><a name="ref11_6"></a>(6) If you are running supercell calculations (i.e.
    an isolated atom or molecule in a big box, or a defect in a solid, or a slab
    calculation) you must check the convergence of your calculation with respect
    to the supercell and system size.
  <ul>
    <li>For an isolated molecule in a big box : increase concurrently the three
      dimensions of your supercell (<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/basic.html#acell">acell</a>),
      and check the convergence of your physical property.
    <li>For a defect in a solid : your supercell must be a multiple of the primitive
      cell of the bulk solid, so you have less freedom. Still, be sure that your
      supercell is large enough for your properties of interest to be accurate
      at the level you want it to be.
    <li>For a slab calculation : you must increase the vacuum in the cell, but
      also the thickness of your slab systematically...
