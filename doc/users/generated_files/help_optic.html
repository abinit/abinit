<h2>Frequency dependent linear optical dielectric function and second order nonlinear optical susceptibility.</h2>
<hr>
<a name="top"></a>
<p>
This file explains the i/o parameters needed for the calculation of the
frequency dependent linear optical dielectric function and second order
nonlinear optical susceptibility, in the RPA approximation (sum over states using 
independent electronic states) thanks to the Optic utility
of the ABINIT package.
<p> The user is advised to be familiar with
the main <a href="../../users/generated_files/help_abinit.html">abinit help file</a> before reading the present file.
<p>
A knowledge of the computation of the linear response d/dk
perturbation, explained in the
<A href="help_respfn.html">ABINIT (respfn) help file</A>, is also requested.
Actually, a full understanding of the ABINIT treatment of perturbation (respfn) should NOT be requested
in order to use Optic, but with the present ordering of the help files and tutorial, this is not obvious.
In a future version, the tutorials and help files will be reorder and modified.
<p>
It will be easier to discover the present file with the help of the tutorial (<a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_optic.html">lesson_optic</a>).
<br>It is worthwhile to print this help file, for ease of reading.

<h3><b><a name="1"></a>1. Introduction </b></h3>
Optic allows to compute the
frequency dependent linear optical dielectric function and second order
nonlinear optical susceptibility.
An introduction to such computations is given in the following paper :
<ul>
 <li><a name="Ref1"></a> Ref. 1 : S. Sharma and C. Ambrosch-Draxl
  Physica Scripta T109, 128 (2004) or online:
  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0305016">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0305016</a>  </li>
</ul>
The following are also very useful references :
<ul>
 <li><a name="Ref2"></a> Ref. 2 : James L. P. Hughes and J. E. Sipe, Phys. Rev. B 53 10751 (1996) </li>
 <li><a name="Ref3"></a> Ref. 3 : C. Ambrosch-Draxl and J. O. Sofo,  online:
   <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0402523">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0402523</a> </li>
 <li><a name="Ref4"></a> Ref. 4 : S. Sharma J. K. Dewhurst and C. Ambrosch-Draxl
  Phys. Rev. B 67 165332 (2003) or online:
  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211512">http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0211512</a> </li>
</ul>
Before going to the detailed explanation of the Optic utility, the user
is advised to get familiar to the theory behind it, explained in these
references. So, either you know this theory and you continue the tutorial,
or you should stop the tutorial here, and read at least <a href="#Ref1">Ref. 1</a>.

<p>
The specific purpose of the Optic utility is to read in the position matrix elements
generated by ABINIT (also giving the momentum matrix elements), and then use Eq. 46 in
<a href="#Ref1">Ref. 1</a>
to determine the
linear and Eqs. 49, 50 and 51 in <a href="#Ref1">Ref. 1</a> to determine the nonlinear
optical response of the material under investigation.

<h3><b><a name="2"></a>2. How to run Optic ? </b></h3>

<p>
The use of Optic is quite simple :
<pre>
optic < optic.files > optic.log
</pre>
where the optic.files file contains three information : the name
of the input file, the name of an output file (actually unused), and
the root name for all other output files. These input files
will be described in the next section.

<p>
However, before being able to use Optic, you must have obtained, from the main abinit program,
four different files, corresponding to the physical system that you want to study:
<ul>
 <li>The ground state wavefunction file, indexed with _WFK </li>
 <li>Three files containing the matrix elements of the position operator (or the derivative with respect to wavevector),
     one for each direction of space</li>
</ul>
Supposing you have read
the <A href="help_abinit.html"><B>main ABINIT help file</B></A>,
the production of the first file should not require any additional explanation.
However, the way to obtain the matrix elements is worth explaining.
<br>
The long-wave method as well as the Berry-phase treatment of electric field,
allow to establish the equivalence between
the off-diagonal matrix elements of the position operator, and the
off-diagonal matrix elements of the derivative with respect to the wavevector (d/dk),
for the periodic part of the Bloch functions, see for example
section VI of X. Gonze, Phys. Rev. B 55, 10337 (1997),
or Nunes and Gonze, Phys. Rev. B 63, 155107 (2001), and references therein.
Moreover, a straightforward relationship exists between these matrix elements,
and the matrix elements of the momentum operator.
<p>
The main abinit program has
the capability to compute derivatives of wavefunctions with respect to their
wavevector. This is explained in the
<A href="help_respfn.html"><B>ABINIT (respfn) help file</B></A>.
Such a calculation implies treating three d/dk perturbations, with numbers 3*natom+1,
3*natom+2 and 3*natom+3 (that is, for a unit cell with 2 atoms, perturbations
number 7, 8 and 9). In the 2-atom case, the associated files needed for Optic have the
index _1WF7 , _1WF8 , and _1WF9 .
<p> The formalism implemented in Optic treats explicitly
the eigenstates lying in the range of energy between the lowest
occupied wavefunction and the highest one plus the maximal excitation energy
(chosen by the user).
All the other ones are neglected. This has two important consequences for the
preliminary runs :
<ul>
 <li>The ground calculation must produce explicitly all the eigenstates
     and eigenvalues for that target range of energy, so it cannot be restricted to the occupied wavefunctions only</li>
 <li>One does not need the full change of Bloch wavefunctions with respect to d/dk, but only
     the matrix elements between the wavefunctions of this range of energy</li>
</ul>
Because of the latter, the computation of the response to d/dk perturbations is much
shorter than usual : indeed, the matrix elements between the explicitly ground-state
wavefunctions are computed at the very beginning of the abinit(respfn) run. It is not
worth to make a full calculation of the modification of the wavefunctions due to a change
of wavevector.

<h3><b><a name="3"></a>3. Optic input file and input variables </b></h3>

A typical optic.files file is presented below :
<pre>
optic.in     ! Name of input file
optic.out    ! Unused
optic        ! Root name for all files that will be produced
</pre>

Please note that the format of input files for Optic has changed from Abinit v8.0
Since very few input parameters are required for Optic, the optic.in file contains them with the namelist format.

In Eq. 46 of <a href="#Ref1">Ref. 1</a>, it is clear that when ever wnm(k) is equal to w,
there is a resonance. Numerically this would lead to an infinity. In order to
avoid this one could do two things. You could change the sum over k-points to
integration and then use linear tetrahedron method (see <a href="#Ref2">Ref. 2</a> for
details). Another way to get around the problem is, like we do in the present
case, avoid this singularity by adding a small complex number to the denominator.
This prevents the denominator from ever going to 0 and acts as a broadening to
the spectrum. The broadening should not be too large as this would wash out the
features in the spectrum.

LDA/GGA are well known to underestimate the band-gap by up to 100%. In order
to get the optical spectrum and make a realistic comparison with experiments
one needs to correct for this. This can be achieved in two ways. The scissors
shift is normally chosen to be the difference between the experimental and
theoretical band-gap and is used to shift the conduction bands only. Another
way in which you do not have to rely on experimental data is to determine the
self energy using the <a href="../../tutorial/generated_files/lesson_gw1.html">GW approach</a>.
In this case the opening of the gap due to the GW correction can be used as
scissor shift.

<h3><b><a name="5"></a>5. Trouble shooting </b></h3>

<p>
1) All I get is zeros in my *-linopt.out file. Why?

<p>
There are several possibilities.
<br>
Let us explore some of them here:
<ul>
 <li>(i) The component of the dielectric tensor that you are looking at could be zero
    due to symmetry of the crystal. Normally zz component is a good place to
    start. It is almost never zero. So check the file case__0003_0003-linopt.out.</li>

 <li>(ii) If the components zz is zero this is more serious, if you are using the
     default input file t57.in then please check that  on the line number 10
     the second number is 33. If you are not using the default input file
     please calculate the 33 (or zz) component and make sure it is not zero.</li>

 <li>(iii) If even zz component is zero then possibilities are endless maximum
      frequency on line number 6 of t57.in is too small, or the number of bands
      used for performing ground state calculation are too small.</li>
</ul>
<p>
2) All I get is zeros in my *-ChiKIND.out file. Why?

<p>
Two most common mistakes are:
<ul>
 <li>(i) You are calculating the second order response for material with inversion
    symmetry in this case all the components will be correctly zero or very
    small like 10-15.</li>

 <li>(ii) Most components out of the 27 are zero due to the symmetry of the crystal.
     Please calculate a different component.</li>
</ul>
