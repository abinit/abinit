Version 6.6, released on February 7, 2011.

Changes with respect to version 6.4 :

A. WARNINGS.
B. Most noticeable achievements (for users)
C. Changes in the package, for developers
D. Other changes (or on-going developments, not finalized)

__________________________________________________________________

A.  WARNINGS AND IMPORTANT REMARKS

A.1 The user interface of the build system has changed.
    The plugins are currently being replaced by a mechanism of
    connectors / fallbacks. As a consequence, a few options of the
    configure script have changed:
      - a new --with-dft-flavor option allows for the detection and
        possible build of AtomPAW, BigDFT, LibXC, and Wannier90;
      - a new --with-trio-flavor option allows for the detection and
        possible build of ETSF_IO, FoX, and NetCDF;
      - the --enable-* options related to the above plugins have been
        removed, but their --with-* options have been kept;
      - the --enable-all-plugins has been removed, and its former
        outcome can be reproduced by using both:
          --with-dft-flavor="atompaw+bigdft+libxc+wannier90"
          --with-trio-flavor="etsf_io+fox+netcdf"
        or by setting these two options to "none" to disable all
        plugins.
    Please have a look at ~abinit/doc/build/config-template.ac for
    complete details. The output of configure contains as well useful
    information about changed options at its beginning.
    In order to facilitate the transition, you'll find the
    extras/build/upgrade-build-config script. Call it using -h or --help
    for documentation.

B.  Most noticeable achievements

B.1 The PAW atomic dataset generator ATOMPAW, from Natalie Holzwarth and coworkers,
    has been adapted as a plugin for ABINIT. The interface with ABINIT is tested
    automatically, thanks to tests in tests/atompaw. 
    ATOMPAW compiles correctly on all the standard testing platforms of ABINIT,
    so that it is considered as being part of the 
    standard reference configuration of the ABINIT package.
    The executable is generated in plugins/atompaw .
    Also, the ability to use libxc with atompaw is present, and the pseudopotentials that have
    been generated can be used without mentioning the ixc value (that is passed to
    ABINIT transparently for the user).
    Tests are tests/atompaw #01 and #02 (generation of the PAW dataset by PAW then use by ABINIT),
    and tests/libxc #10 (use of a PAW dataset for PBEsol).
    Plugin set-up and interfacing with ABINIT
    done by Yann Pouillon, Jean-Michel Beuken, Marc Torrent, Joe Zwanziger and XG, in collaboration 
    with N. Holzwarth.
    ATOMPAW from Natalie Holzwarth and Alan Tackett.

B.2 Two new tutorials are available : 
    - lesson_detu.html, for the determination of the U and J values from the method by Coccochioni and de Gironcoli
         (see the release_notes of v6.4, section B.4, for the announcement of the related input variables and automatic tests).
    - lesson_paw3.html, for the testing of Atomic dataset, compared to the ELK code.
    Work by D. Adams and B. Amadon (for the U+J tutorial), and M. Stankovski for the PAW3 tutorial.

B.3 The usage of MPIIO can be now considered in production for the FFT/Band parallelism of ABINIT.
    Automatic tests in tests/mpiio have been shown to work on all platforms of the ABINIT test farm,
    except with the pathscale compiler, and under Windows.
    Build system tuning, and then testing by Y. Pouillon, Jean-Michel Beuken, M. Giantomassi, XG.
    Initial MPIIO implementation by M. Boulet, F. Bottin and G. Zerah, improved by M. Delaveau and M. Torrent.

B.4 The plasmon-pole models 2-3-4 can now be used in GW+PAW.
    By M. Giantomassi

C. Changes for the developers

C.1 Max and littlebuda are two new slaves for the test farm : 
    - max tests the parallelism up to 10 procs using Myrinet; 
    - littlebuda tests the compilation and links with GPU turned on. No tests activated yet, though.
    By J.-M. Beuken, Y. Pouillon, X. Gonze

C.2 Build systems tests have been set-up . They are activated on the "inca" slave.
