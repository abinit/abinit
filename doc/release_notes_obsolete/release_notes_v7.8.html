Version 7.8, released on June 30, 2014.

Changes with respect to version 7.6 :

A. WARNINGS.
B. Most noticeable achievements (for users)
C. Changes in the package, for developers
D. Other changes (or on-going developments, not finalized)

__________________________________________________________________

A.  WARNINGS AND IMPORTANT REMARKS

A.1 As advertised in the recent announcements of ABINITv7.6, some developers are presently "cleaning" ABINIT,
    i.e. removing little used code, or rarely used capabilities, that were slowing down the
    developments by requiring too much maintenance.
    As a consequence, in ABINITv7.8, some backward compatibilities have been broken.
    In particular, the input variable mkmem (and associated mkqmem, mk1mem, mffmem) have been removed. 
    Calculations using out-of-core storing of wavefunctions are not possible anymore.
    Instead, the user should rely on the parallelisation, with distributed memory. 
    The computation of lattice wannier function has also been disabled, as well as the self-consistent
    phonon calculations (see C.7).

A.2 Although the availability of NetCDF, libxc, and MPI-IO (in case of parallelism) is not yet mandatory,
    v7.8 is likely the last version of ABINIT for which NetCDF is not mandatory (it will be mandatory
    for ABINITv8). On the other hand the requirement of libxc and MPI-IO will likely not be enforced in ABINITv8 .

B.  Most noticeable achievements

B.1 Computation of the U parameter (for LDA+U or DMFT), using the cRPA screened interaction formalism.
    This is available based on two models : the d-dp(b) model or the energy range model.
    For the latter, see the new input variable ucrpa_window.
    Tests v7#68 and 69.
    Published in Phys. Rev.B 89, 125110 (2014).
    By B. Amadon and T. Applencourt
    This can be used in LDA+U as well as in DMFT
    (Note :  the CTQMC solver has been included in the trunk (dmft_solv=5), see the release notes for ABINITv7.6, point B.2)

B.2 The Path-Integral Molecular Dynamics in NVT ensemble is now available
    with two thermostats (Langevin and Nose-Hoover chains) and possible coordinate transformations (primitive, staging, normal modes).
    See the test v7#08 .
    Adiabatic Path-Integral Molecular Dynamics is under development. New input variables : adpimd and adpimd_gamma. 
    Work by G. Geneste and M. Torrent.

B.3 Computation of the random stopping power, in the RPA and in the TD-LDA.
    Input variables npvel and pvelmax.
    Test v7#67 .
    Work by A. Shukri and F. Bruneval.

B.4 Response function from Molecular Dynamics
    Phonon spectrum obtained from trajectories (with a minimal set of coefficients)
    Included in APPA.
    Work by Francois Bottin, Johann Bouchet, and Alexandre Martin

B.5 ABINIT has the capability to read the pseudopotentials created by the ONCVPSP code by D. Hammann.
    Also including the spin-orbit interaction. Documentation available in doc/psp_infos/psp8_info_txt .
    See test v7#07
    Work by D. Hamann

B.6 Computation of the electron-phonon transport in the inelastic variational approximation are in beta testing.
    See test v6#95.
    Work by Bin Xu and M. Verstraete

B.7 FFT : completion of the parallel implementation for fftalg=312 (FFTW3) and fftalg=401 and 402 (SGoedecker) ,
    also with unitary testing.
    Also, paral_kgb=1 can take advantage of composite operations (fftalg=402, 312)
    New MPI-FFT version based on zero-padding and powered by FFTW3/MKL (312)
    Automatic selection of the best FFT algorithm depending on the value of npfft
    See tests tfftfftw3 #05,06 and tfftsg #05,06
    NOTE : at present the default value of fftalg is still 401 when FFTW3 is not available and paral_kgb==1.
     Users are encourages to use fftalg 402 or even better 312 for their calculations. Later, the default
     will be changed to 402 - automatic test references have to be updated.
    Work by M. Giantomassi

B.8 Constrained magnetization calculations can now be performed.
    Input variables magconon and magcon_lambda
    From M. Verstraete, I. Lukacevic and E. Bousquet

C. Changes for the developers

C.1 The test farm has undergone many modifications. 
    New bots : 
    - tikal_gcc49 : gfort v4.9 is thus officially supported. This bot is used for full debugging.
    - petrus_nag (NAG 5.3.1) : NAG compiler is officially supported. The debugging is quite aggressive. 
    - buda_intel14 (14.0.2) : quite aggressive optim : -O3 -xhost
    - bigmac_gcc48_sl : testing MacPorts, and Scalapack is also activated.
    Rendering ABINIT NAG enabled was a significant debugging work for ABINIT ! 

    Updated bots :
    - ktulu_gcc48 (ubuntu packages) : OS ubuntu 14.04 instead of ubuntu 10.04
    - inca_gcc44_sdebug (for buildsys and abirules) : use of make (version 4) able to synchronize output with -j option
    - cronos_gcc46_paral : executes the entire test with np=2

    Suppressed different bots : amd-g95_milou_ftrace_nofb, amd-g95_milou_ftrace_serial_nofb, amd-gfortran4.8_milou_fpetrap_nofb,
    amd-gfortran4.8_milou_fpetrap_serial_nofbi, intel-gfortran4.4_ktulu,  intel-gfortran4.7_bigmac_sernofb
    xeon-g95_green, xeon-intel11_green

    The following compilers are either obsolete, or considered too unstable/buggy for ABINIT :
    g95, pathscale, open64 . This does not mean that ABINIT will not work, but there is no guarantee for ABINIT to run correctly.

    Work by JM Beuken, and MGiantomassi, with contributions from Vittorio Zecca for the NAG enabling.

C.2 The modularization of the build system is progressing : bindings is autonomous ; 
    creation of the "watch" subdirectory ; "Special" tests have been separated from usual non-regression tests.
    See https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=maintainers:buildsys:roadmap_v8
    Work by Y. Pouillon

C.3 The modularization of the sources is progressing : many subroutines have been gathered in modules. 
    About two dozen of new modules have been created : m_alloc.F90, m_anaddb_dataset.F90, 
    m_array.F90, m_atmdata.F90, m_ddb.F90, 
    m_dfpt_db.F90, m_doublegrid.F90, m_dynmat.F90, m_eig2d.F90, m_ewald.F90, m_fftcore.F90, m_fstrings.F90, m_ifc.F90, m_kxc.F90,
    m_psps.F90, m_sg2002.F90, m_special_funcs.F90, m_xieee.F90, 
    Work by Matteo Giantomassi (and others)

C.4 The script mkrobodoc_dirs.py, to provide headers of directories for ROBODOC, has been written.
    Work by Matteo Giantomassi 

C.5 There is a new naming scheme for the procedures exported by m_xmpi (e.g. old: xsum_mpi, new: xmpi_sum)
    Work by Matteo Giantomassi.

C.6 The creation of sections of output written in YAML (see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML ) is progressing.
    See the use of yaml_out in abinit.F90, anaddb.F90 and optic.F90
     (Note : in ABINITv7.6, The build system supports YAML, and The YAML library has been integrated in the build system)
    Work by M. Giantomassi and Y. Pouillon

C.7 Cleaning : suppression of lattice wannier function (LWF) calculations, and self-consistent phonon calculations (SCPhon).
    The automatic tests for LWF, v3#96 and 97, and for SCPhon, v5#100 have been suppressed.
    Input variables for SCPhon have been suppressed : prepscphon, scphon_temp, scphon_supercell.
    By M. Giantomassi and M. Verstraete
