Version 6.12, released on January 30, 2012.

Changes with respect to version 6.10 :

A. WARNINGS.
B. Most noticeable achievements (for users)
C. Changes in the package, for developers
D. Other changes (or on-going developments, not finalized)

__________________________________________________________________

A.  WARNINGS AND IMPORTANT REMARKS

A.1 As mentioned in B.2, the standard version of LibXC is now 1.1.0 instead of 1.0.0 . 
    There has been a few numerical changes, esp. in the PBE functional and the mGGAs ...
    Also, functional number 104 is no more the Becke 86 Xalfa,beta,gamma (reoptimized)
    but Herman Xalphabeta GGA.

__________________________________________________________________

B.  Most noticeable achievements
 
B.1 The Ground-state calculations can benefit from GPUs, with CUDA library.
    See the input variable use_gpu_cuda, as well as the tests contained in the tests/gpu
    subdirectory.
    This functionnality is still in beta stage and has to be used carefully.
    Note that to take benefit of the GPU efficiency the computation load has to be large enough.
    Abinit has to be compiled with the NVidia Cuda package (v3.2+) as well as the Magma library (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/).
    Relevant configure options: --enable-gpu, --with-gpu-flavor, --with-gpu-prefix, NVCC, NVCC_FLAGS
    and --with-linalg-flavor (for Magma activation).
    When Abinit has been compiled with Cuda and an available Graphics card is detected, ground-states calculations
     are automatically done on the GPU. This can de deactivated by setting "use_gpu_cuda 0" in the input file.
    Note that, when doing a GS calculation one GPU, some defaults are automatically changed: LOBPCG algorithm use
    is forced (wfoptalg=14), Ylm version of non-local operator is selected, FFT algorithm is forced to be 401.
    All these changes do not modify the final result of ground-state calculations.
    (F. Dahm and M. Torrent, with some testing by JM Beuken)

B.2 The LibXC version 1.1.0 is now interfaced with ABINIT, instead of LibXC version 1.0.0 .
    There are numerous new LDA/GGA functionals of which the portability has been tested.
    New functionals that can be used with ABINIT (numbers refer to the index given in the description of the ixc input variable): 
    - 3 LDA (number 22,23,24) 
    - 9 X-GGA (number 139,140,141,142,144,145,149,183,184)
    - 4 C-GGA (number 143, 147, 148, 186)
    - 3 XC-GGA (number 146, 170, 171)
    The documentation is up-to-date, and also include the documentation 
    of different functionals that were previously already available (125,126, 172->181)
    See the automatic tests libxc#17,18,19 .
    See also the warning A.1
    (work by XG + YPouillon and JMBeuken, and of course, the LibXC team, esp. M. Marques)

B.3 Tutorials for parallelism (also Bethe-Salpether)
    For the needs of the ABINIT hands-on tutorial for High-performance computing at the TGCC in Bruyeres-le-chatel,
    November 2011, http://sites.google.com/site/abinit2011tutorial, a set of six new lessons for the ABINIT tutorial has been created :
    ground state with plane waves, ground state with wavelets, molecular dynamics, parallelism on "images", 
    response functions, Many-Body Perturbation Theory .
    They are available on the Web, as well as in the package, entry point doc/tutorial/welcome.html.
    A new directory for testing the has been created : tests/tutoparal.
    The old lesson on parallelism, obsolete, has been cleaned and is now up-to-date, and coherent with the other lessons.
    The tutorials all demonstrate, for different capabilities of ABINIT, that a speed-up of more than one hundred
    is achievable. 
    By the way, in the process of setting up the tutorials, tests and improvements of the scaling were made, for the
    different functionalities.

    There is also another new tutorial (sequential) on the use of the Bethe-Salpether equation to compute optical properties,
    created for v6.12 : see doc/tutorial/lesson_bse.html
    Also, the tutorial on GW has been considerably improved.

    Work by M. Torrent, F. Jollet, B. Amadon, G. Geneste, J. Bouchet, G. Jomard, M. Stankovski, M. Giantomassi, F. Bruneval,
    F. Bottin, D. Caliste, L. Genovese.
   
B.4 The latest version of the BigDFT library has been interfaced with ABINIT : switch from BigDFT 1.2 to BigDFT 1.6 .
    This allowed to develop the tutorial on BigDFT in parallel.
    Work by D. Caliste (and of course the whole BigDFT tesm, esp. L. Genovese and T. Deutsch).

C. Changes for the developers

C.1 All the "allocate/deallocate" instructions have been replaced by "ABI_ALLOCATE/ABI_DEALLOCATE"
    (ABI_DATATYPE_(DE)ALLOCATE for pointers).
    This project, lead by David Waroquiers, aims to allow memory control and monitoring.

C.2 Previously a set of blanks might have been introduced by abiauty, changing
    !$OMP
    to something like
    !   $OMP
    depending on the alignment with other neighboring lines.
    The abiauty script has been modified, so that the lines starting with 
    !$OMP
    will now be unchanged by abiauty. This is the expected behaviour of abiauty for future developments inside
    ABINIT, in order not to have abiauty destroying the OMP directives.
    (By the way, comments can also be leaved unaffected by abiauty, if they start with !!OMP )

C.3 There have been many improvements for the test farm.
    Among other developments :
    - new "on_push" server to test quickly the public branch freshly committed
      (already active but not for production 
    - new nightly builders :
        - tikal with pathscale 4.0
        - max2 with Open64
        - ktulu with native deb packages ( gcc44, fftw3, atlas, openmpi,...)
    - new "on_demand only" builders :
        - buda_gcc45_checks to check quickly buildsys
        - buda_gcc45_cuda to test GPU/CUDA
        - shiva_gcc45_abiauty 
        - tikal_intel11_openmp to test OpenMP
    - removed nightly builder : bigmac_gcc43
    (JM Beuken)

C.4 Improvement/modifications of the build system :
    - Switched from plugins to connectors / fallbacks.
    - Added connector for Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares
      algorithms (levmar).
    - Added build-system support for flexible MPI compiler wrappers.
    - Automated the triggering of defines and conditionals.
    - Added build-system support for multiple shared-object file extensions.
    - Added build-system support for the Magma library.
    - Fully modularized the build system into 5 blocks: core, doc, fallbacks,
      gui, and tests, to allow for asynchronous improvements on each block
      while preserving the overall robustness.
    - Rewrote makemake as a configurable Python script. Obsoleted the
      clean-source-tree script.
    - Fixed various consistency issues.
    - Enhanced and refactored build-system outputs.
    (Y. Pouillon)

C.5 The name of the routine is now defined automatically, thanks to the ABI_FUNC macro. The abilint script
    automatically creates it.
    (M. Giantomassi)

    New input variable for ANADDB : ep_extrael.
    New tests : Tv6#103 and 104.
    (Bin Xu, M. Verstraete) 

D.6 The preconditioners defined by non-zero iprcel values (extrapolar-type) can now be used used safely
    with PAW. See the input variable pawsushat, and the test paral#W .
    (M. Torrent)

D.7 Computation of the chemical shielding, on-going development. Definition of the input variable
    prtcs, not operational yet, though.
    Orbital magnetization and Chern number can be computed, but at present, only in the nspinor=nsppol=1 case.
    More possibilities (esp. related to spin/spinor) under development.
    (J. Zwanziger).

D.8 To avoid numerical problems with some XC functionals (see point B.2), a new input varaible, xc_denpos,
    has been introduced, to allow avoiding the density to vanish, and avoid spurious divergences.
    See test Libxc#13 .
    (XG)

D.19 Phonon calculations using DFPT can be done reliably with the PAW methodology,
     for the insulating case. 
     The metal case is operational (under the same conditions), except for q=0 (not fully implemented).
     The electric field response was already available previously.
     Still, for the time being, mixing of electric field and atomic displacement is not allowed.
     Not yet possible to do calculations with spinors.
