Version 6.4, released on September 27, 2010.

Changes with respect to version 6.2 :

A. WARNINGS.
B. Most noticeable achievements (for users)
C. Changes in the package, for developers
D. Other changes (or on-going developments, not finalized)

__________________________________________________________________

A.  WARNINGS AND IMPORTANT REMARKS

A.1 The format of the DOS file has changed : the index field column has been suppressed. It is easier to plot this file
    with standard graphic packages.
    By M. Verstraete

A.2 Removed a bug in the computation of the temperature-dependence of the gap (and electronic structure).
    The reference files for test v5#26, 27, 28 have been corrected.
    By P. Boulanger and X. Gonze

A.3 Many different options have been added to the prtden variable. It contains the features previously activated by pawprtden.
    See v5#11 for prtden 2 (causes generation of a file _PAWDEN that contains the bulk
    valence charge density together with the PAW on-site contributions, and has the same format as the other density files
    (Test cases to be provided for prtden 3 to 6 !)
    By D. Waroquiers

A.4 A numerical bug present in v6.4.1 has been fixed in v6.4.2 . It concerned GW-PAW calculations only,
    the computation of the head and wings of the susceptbility matrix at q=0.
    Expect the changes in the QP energies to be around tens of meV. 
    Results for systems sampled at Gamma only were correct though.

A.5 The default value for ecutwfn and ecutsigx is now set to ecut.

B.  Most noticeable achievements

B.1 The computation of the RPA energy in the GW part of ABINIT is now available.
    Coded in the norm-conserving and PAW cases 
    Several techniques have been implemented : use of logarithmic formula, use of numerical integration over the interaction.
    It can be combined with the extrapolar trick and the range separated Coulomb interactions.
    Test v6#99. Input variable gwrpacorr .
    By F. Bruneval

B.2 Implementation of the GW Effective Energy Technique, by J.A. Berger .
    See J.A. Berger, L. Reining, and F. Sottile, Phys. Rev. B 82, 041103(R) (2010).
    Presently only norm-conserving pseudos are supported.
    Parallel implementation on k-points and occupied states (gwpara=1) but not yet on memory (gwpara=2).
    Related input variables (not operational yet) gw_EET and gw_EET_nband.
    Automatic test Tv6#90
    Work by J.A. Berger, some help by M. Giantomassi.

B.3 Several advanced features of the GW part of ABINIT can now be used safely.
    In particular QPSCGW + PAW is OK, as well as self-consistent COHSEX + PAW.
    Extrapolar works with SCGW, also with PAW.
    SCGW has now been implemented with symmetries (HF, COHSEX, SEX), and use of
    hermitianity (speed up of the calculations).
    The memory is better controlled, thanks to the gwmem input variable.
    Two different FFT meshes defined by ecuteps and ecusigx are used to calculate the
    matrix elements the exchange and the correlation part of the self-energy, respectively.
    A new optdriver level has been addded for performing self-consistent GW calculations.
    Related input variables gw_nstep, gw_sctype, gw_sctype_name, gw_toldfeig.
    Work by M. Giantomassi

B.4 The capability to compute the U or J values, within the DFT+U (LDA or GGA) approach (with PAW, also spin-polarized), 
    according to the method of Coccocioni and De Gironcoli (2005), is available in production. 
    Input variable : macro_uj, pawujat, pawujv, and pawujrad. 
    Automatic tests : Tv5#38, 39, Tv6#41 
    Work by D. Adams and B. Amadon

B.5 Print out VASP-style POSCAR and FORCES files, for use with PHON or frophon codes for frozen phonon calculations.
    Input variable prtposcar. See also the script extras/post_processing/phondisp2abi.py for easy use with PHON or
    equivalents (generates dataset inputs for abinit runs).
    Test v6#100.
    By M. Verstraete.

B.6 The distribution of processors in the FFT/Band/k point parallelism can be found automatically. 
    Input variable : paral_kgb .
    Work by F. Jollet

C. Changes for the developers

C.1 Shiva, a new slave for the test farm has been set up : it tests the
    distcheck (creation of the distribution package, and test of this
    distribution package). It tests also the creation of html files. It
    makes sure as well that configure options which are rarely used do
    not break the build.
    By J.-M. Beuken, Y. Pouillon, X. Gonze

C.2 The use of the FOX library is now tested automatically. A new directory tests/fox has been created
    for this purpose, with two tests for pseudopotential files written in xml. Should be generalized for all slaves.
    By M. Verstraete, J.-M. Beuken, X. Gonze

C.3 There is an on-going big restructuration of the routines involved in the change
    of the atomic coordinates and cell parameters (called by gstate.F90, linke brdmin.F90), also coupled with on-going
    changes to accommodate the images (above gstate.F90).
    New tests of previous implementations were created, v5#02, for ionmov 2,3,20 .
    Some other tests were reorganised, e.g. v6#03, 04, 05 were combined.
    By G.A. Franco .
