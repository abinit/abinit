<pre>
Many thanks to the contributors to the ABINIT project between
July 2014 and October 2014. These release notes
are relative to improvements of ABINITv7.10 with respect to v7.8.

This version 7.10 was not initially planned for release, as the cleaning on top of ABINITv7.8
had started, and should have been followed by ABINITv8.0. Some nice development could however not been merged
in ABINITv7.8, while the last released version of ABINITv7 was intended to be used for the writing of the next ABINIT paper.
So, it was decided to release ABINITv7.10, albeit with only few noticeable achievements with respect to ABINITv7.8.


The list of contributors includes :
B. Amadon, J.-M. Beuken, J. Bieder, E. Bousquet, F.Bruneval, M. Delaveau, A. Gerossier, M. Giantomassi, Y. Gillet, F. Jollet,
G. Jomard, A. Levitt, S. Ponce, Y. Pouillon, G.-M. Rignanese, M. Torrent, M. Van Setten, M. Verstraete, Bin Xu, J. Zwanziger

It is worth to read carefully
all the modifications that are mentioned in the present file,
and examine the links to help files or test cases ...
This might take some time ...

Version 7.10, released on November 3, 2014.

Changes with respect to version 7.8 :

A. WARNINGS.
B. Most noticeable achievements (for users)
C. Changes in the package, for developers
D. Other changes (or on-going developments, not finalized)

__________________________________________________________________

A.  WARNINGS AND IMPORTANT REMARKS

A.1 Although the availability of NetCDF, libxc, and MPI-IO (in case of parallelism) is not yet mandatory,
    v7.10 is likely the last version of ABINIT for which NetCDF is not mandatory (it will be mandatory
    for ABINITv8). On the other hand the requirement of libxc and MPI-IO will likely not be enforced in ABINITv8 .

B.  Most noticeable achievements

B.1 For the massively parallel computations (ground state), there is a new algorithm based on Chebyshev filtering, 
    designed for very large number of processors, in the regime where LOBPCG does not scale anymore (typically beyond 500 procs for band-FFT work)
    It is not able to use preconditionning and therefore might converge slower than other algorithms; when convergence is poor, a good idea is to use
    more bands than strictly necessary, by increasing nband and using nbdbuf input variable.
    Use the input variable wfoptalg=1, and test patal#30. 
    See also the new input variable use_gemm_nonlop, for more performance in case a good BLAS GEMM routine is available (at the expense of memory).
    For more information, see the performance guide (doc/theory/howto_chebfi.pdf).
    A paper, written by A. Levitt and M. Torrent is available at "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4350" .

B.2 A more general implementation of projected local orbital Wannier functions, in view of doing Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).
    See the input variable plowan_compute, as well as the auxiliary input variables plowan_bandi, plowan_bandf, 
    plowan_iatom, plowan_it, plowan_lcalc, plowan_natom, plowan_nbl, plowan_nt, plowan_projcalc, plowan_realspace.
    See the tests v7#71 and 72.
    This can also be used to build a simplified interpolated band structure.
    Work by A. Gerossier and B. Amadon

B.3 The Bethe-Salpeter Equation can be solved with conjugate gradient algorithm.
    See test v67mbpt#16.
    Work by M. Giantomassi

B.4 Computation of positron Doppler broadening.
    k-point parallelization is implemented. Band-FFT paralleization is under development.
    Electron-positron momentum distribution calculations for each k-point is allowed.
    See "posdoppler" input variable and test v7#t30.
    From J. Wiktor, M. Torrent and G. Jomard.

B.5 Temperature-dependence of the gap
    Inclusion of dynamical corrections, according to Eq. 5.42 of Grimvall. Computation of lifetime.
    Writing of a tutorial for the temperature dependence of the gap, 
    available at https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=howto:temperature .
    Work by S. Ponce

B.6 Electronic entropy in Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT).
    See the input variable dmft_entropy and dmft_nlambda
    See the tests v7#29 and v7#30-31.
    The electronic entropy is calculated performing a thermodynamical integration over the screened coulomb interaction.
    The calculation is currently only available when the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo solver (see dmft_solv) is used for the DMFT.
    Work by J. Bieder and B. Amadon

C. Changes for the developers

C.1 Some routines that are not called at all, have been put in a separate directory "quarantine".
    Work by Y. Pouillon

C.2 Development of a GUI to view and edit the input variable documentation file, when it is translated in YAML.
    Work by Y. GIllet

C.3 Allowed API compatibility ranges for LibXC
    From Y. Pouillon

C.4 Replacement of m_profiling by m_profiling_abi, and similar change of naming, in order
    to suppress duplication of names between bigdft and abinit .

C.6 Lot of clean-up already done by Matteo Giantomassi ...

C.7 The GPU automatic tests are now executed with CUDA 6.5 on a NVIDIA K40s card.
