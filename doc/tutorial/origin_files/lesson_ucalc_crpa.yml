intro : |
  <p>This lesson aims at showing how to perform
  a calculation of <i>U</i> and <i>J</i> in Abinit using cRPA.
  This method is well adapted in particular to determine <i>U</i> and <i>J</i>  as they can be used in DFT+DMFT.
  The implementation is described in [[Amadon2014]].
  </p>
  
  </p>
  
  <p>It might be useful that you already know how to
  do PAW calculations using ABINIT but it is not mandatory  (you can follow the two lessons
  on PAW in ABINIT
  (<a href="lesson_paw1.html">PAW1</a>,
  <a href="lesson_paw2.html">PAW2</a>)).
  The DFT+U tutorial in ABINIT
  (<a href="lesson_dftu.html">DFT+U</a>) might be useful to know some basic variables
  about correlated orbitals.</p>
  The first GW tutorial in ABINIT
  (<a href="lesson_gw1.html">GW</a>) is useful to learn how
  to compute the screening, and how to converge the relevant parameters
  (energy cutoffs and number of bands for the polarizability). </p>
  
  <p>This lesson should take two hours to
  complete (you should have access to more than 8 processors).</p>

 title: "The cRPA method to compute effective interaction: summary and key parameters"
 tag: method
 body: |
  The cRPA method aims at computing the effective interactions
  among correlated electrons. Generally, these highly correlated
  materials contain rare-earth metals or transition metals, which have partially
  filled <i>d</i> or <i>f</i> bands and thus localized electrons.
  cRPA relies on the fact that screening processes can be decomposed
  in two steps: Firstly, the bare Coulomb interaction is screened by
  non correlated electrons to produce the effective interaction <i>W<SUB>r</SUB></i>. Secondly,
  correlated electrons screened this interaction to produce the fully screening interaction <i>W</i>.
  [[Aryasetiawan2004]]). However, the second screening process
  is taken into account when one uses a method which describes accurately the interaction among
  correlated electrons (such as Quantum Monte Carlo within the DFT+DMFT method). So, to avoid
  a double counting of screening by correlated electrons, the DFT+DMFT methods needs as an input
  the effective interaction <i>W<SUB>r</SUB></i>.
  The goal of this tutorial is to present the implementation
  of this method using Projected Local Orbitals Wannier orbitals in ABINIT (The implementation of cRPA in ABINIT is described in 
  [[Amadon2014]] and projected local orbitals Wannier functions 
  are presented in [[Amadon2008]]). 
   The discussion about
  the localization of Wannier orbitals has some similarities with the beginning
  on the DMFT tutorial (see <a href="lesson_dmft.html#1">here</a>
  and <a href="lesson_dmft.html#2">there</a>)
  </p>
  
  <p> Several parameters (both physical and technical) are important for the cRPA calculation:
   </p>
  
  <UL>
  <LI> <B> The definition of correlated orbitals.</B>
  The first part of the tutorial is similar to the DMFT tutorial and explains the electronic structure
  of SrVO<SUB>3</SUB> and will be used to understand the definition of Wannier orbitals with various extensions.
  Wannier functions are unitarily related to a selected set of Kohn Sham (KS) wavefunctions, specified in ABINIT by band index 
  [[dmftbandi]], and
  [[dmftbandf]].
  	Thus, as empty bands are necessary to build Wannier functions, it is required in DMFT or cRPA calculations
  	that the KS Hamiltonian is correctly diagonalized: use high values for  
  [[nnsclo]], 
  	and 
  [[nline]] for cRPA and DMFT calculations and preceding DFT calculations.
  Another solution used in the present tutorial is to use a specific non self-consistent calculation to diagonalize the hamiltonian, as in GW calculations.
  Concerning the localization or correlated orbitals, 
  generally, the larger dmftbandf-dmftbandi is, the more localized is the radial part of the Wannier orbital.
  Finally, note that Wannier orbitals are used in DMFT and cRPA implementations but this
  is not the most usual choice of correlated orbitals in
  the DFT+U implementation in particular in ABINIT
  (see [[Amadon2008a]]).
  The relation between the two expressions is briefly discussed in [[Geneste2016]].
  
  
  <LI> <B> The constrained polarization calculation.</B> As we will discuss in
  section <a href="#2"> 2</a>, there are different ways
  to define the constrained polarizability, by suppressing in the polarization, some
  electronic transitions:
  As discussed in section I of [[Amadon2014]], one
  can either suppress electronic transition inside a given subset of Kohn-Sham bands.
  In this case, one can use
  [[ucrpa]]=1,
  and choose the first and last bands defining the subset of bands
  by using variable
  [[ucrpa_bands]].
  One can also use an energy windows instead of a number of bands by using
  [[ucrpa_window]].
  
  
  Another solution is to use
  a weighting scheme which lowers the contribution of a given transition, as a function
  of the weight of correlated orbitals on the bands involved in the transition
  (see Eq. (5) and (7) in [[Amadon2014]]).
  In this case, on still use the variable
  [[ucrpa_bands]].
  The variable will in this case be used to define Projected Local Orbitals Wannier functions
  that will then be used to define
  the weighting function in the polarizability.
  (see Eq. (5) and (7) in [[Amadon2014]]).
  
  <LI> <B> Convergence parameters </B> are the same as for a polarizability calculation for the screening calculation
  ([[ecuteps]],
  [[ecutwfn]],
  [[nband]])
  and the same as for the exchange part of GW for the effective interaction, ie
  [[ecutsigx]],
  [[ecutwfn]].
  It is recommended, as discussed in appendix A of [[Amadon2014]],
  to use [[pawoptosc]]=1.
  If the calculation is carried out with several atoms, use [[nsym]]=1, the calculation is not symmetrized over atoms
  in this case.

 title: "Electronic Structure of SrVO<SUB>3</SUB> in LDA"
 tag: LDA
 body: |
  You might create a subdirectory of the
  ~abinit/tests/tutoparal directory, and use it for the tutorial. In what follows,
  the names of files will be mentioned as if you were in this subdirectory</p>
  
  <p>Copy the files ../Input/tucrpa_1.in and
  ../Input/tucrpa_1.files in your Work directory, and run ABINIT: (as usual, the actual "abinit" command is something like  ../../../../src/98_main/abinit):
  <pre>
  abinit < tucrpa_1.files > log_1
  </pre> 
  
  <p>This run should take some time. It is recommended that you use at least 10 processors (and 32 should be fast).
  It calculates the LDA ground state of SrVO<SUB>3</SUB> and compute the band structure in a second step.
  The variable 
  [[pawfatbnd]]
  allows to create files with "fatbands" (see description of the variable
  in the list of variables): the width of the line along each k-point path and for each band is proportional to the contribution
  of a given atomic orbital on this particular Kohn Sham Wavefunction.
  
  A low cutoff and a small number of k-points are used in order to speed up the
  calculation.
  During this time you can take a look at the input file. There are two datasets. The first one is a ground
  state calculations with 
  [[nnsclo]]=3 and
  [[nline]]=3 in order
  to have well diagonalized eigenfunctions even for empty states. In practice, you have however to check
  that the residue of wavefunctions is small at the end of the calculation. In this calculation, we find 1.E-06,
  which is large (1.E-10 would be better, so 
  [[nline]]  and
  [[nnsclo]] 
  should be increased, but it would take more time).
  
  When the calculation is finished, you can plot the fatbands for Vanadium and l=2 with <pre>
  xmgrace tucrpa_O_DS2_FATBANDS_at0001_V_is1_l0002
  </pre> 
  The band structure is given in eV.
  <p align="center"> <img style="width: 634px" alt="FatbandV" src="../documents/lesson_ucalc_crpa/fatbandsV.jpeg">
  </p>
  <p>and the fatbands for one oxygen atom and l=1 with  <pre> 
  xmgrace tucrpa_O_DS2_FATBANDS_at0003_O_is1_l0001.
  </pre> 
  <p align="center">
  <img style="width: 634px" alt="FatbandV" src="../documents/lesson_ucalc_crpa/fatbandsO.jpeg">
  </p>
  
  In these plots, you recover the band structure of SrVO<SUB>3</SUB> (see for comparison 
  the band structure of Fig.3 of [[Amadon2008]]), and the main character of the bands.
  Bands 21 to 25 are mainly <i>d</i> and bands 12 to 20 are  mainly
  oxygen <i>p</i>. However, we clearly see an important hybridization.
  The Fermi level (at 0 eV) is in the middle of bands 21-23.
  
  <p>
  One can easily check thats bands 21-23 are mainly  <i>d-t<SUB>2g</SUB></i> and bands 24-25 are mainly <i>e<SUB>g</SUB></i>:
  just use pawfatbnd=2 in tucrpa_1.in and relaunch the calculations. Then
  the file tucrpa_O_DS2_FATBANDS_at0001_V_is1_l2_m-2, tucrpa_O_DS2_FATBANDS_at0001_V_is1_l2_m-1 and tucrpa_O_DS2_FATBANDS_at0001_V_is1_l2_m1
  give you respectively the xy,yz and xz fatbands (ie  <i>d-t<SUB>2g</SUB></i>) and tucrpa_O_DS2_FATBANDS_at0001_V_is1_l2_m+0 and tucrpa_O_DS2_FATBANDS_at0001_V_is1_l2_m+2
  give the z2 and z2-y2 fatbands (ie <i>e<SUB>g</SUB></i>).
  <p>
  So in conclusion of this study, the Kohn Sham bands which are mainly  <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i> are the bands 21, 22 and 23.
  <p>
  Of course, it could
  have been anticipated from classical crystal field theory: the vanadium is in the center of an octahedron of oxygen atoms, so
  <i>d</i> orbitals are splitted in  <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i> and  <i>e<SUB>g</SUB></i>. As <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i> orbitals are not directed toward oxygen atoms, <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i>-like bands are lower
  in energy and filled with one electron, whereas  <i>e<SUB>g</SUB></i>-like bands are higher and empty.
  <p>
  In the next section, we will thus use the <i>d</i>-like bands to built Wannier functions and compute effective interactions
  for these orbitals.

 title: "Definition of screening and orbitals in cRPA: models, input file and log file"
 tag: definition
 body: |
  <h4><a name="3.1">3.1.  The constrained polarization calculation. </h4>
  As discussed briefly in Appendix A of [[Amadon2014]]
  as well as in section III B of [[Vaugier2012]] and Section II B of [[Sakuma2013]],  one
  can use different schemes for the cRPA calculations. Let us discuss these different models namely the (<i>d-d</i>), (<i>dp-dp</i>), (<i>d-dp</i>(a)), and (<i>d-dp</i>(b)) models. In the notation (A-B), A and B refers respectively to some bands of A-like and B-like character.
  Moreover, A refers to the definition of screening and B refers to the definition of correlated orbitals. 
  To clarify this definition, we give below some examples:
  <ul> 
  <li> <span style="color:rgb(200, 100, 000); font-style: italic">(<i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i>-<i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i>) model (or <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i> model)</span>: The correlated orbitals are defined with only
  <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i>-like bands (bands 21, 22 and 23). The screening inside these bands is not taken into account to built
  the constrained polarizability.
  Note that if this case (and in the (<i>d-d</i>) and (<i>dp-dp</i>) models), using ucrpa=1 or 2 give the same results,
  provided one uses ucrpa_bands equal to ([[dmftbandi]] 
  [[dmftbandf]] ).
  <li> <span style="color:rgb(200, 100, 000); font-style: italic">(<i>d-d</i>) model (or d model) </span>: The correlated orbitals are defined with only
  <i>d</i>-like bands (bands 21 to 25). The screening inside these bands is not taken into account.
  <li> <span style="color:rgb(200, 100, 000); font-style: italic">(<i>dp-dp</i>) model (or dp model)</span>: The correlated orbitals are defined with only
  <i>d</i>-like and Op-like bands (bands 12 to 23). The screening inside these bands is not taken into account.
  <li> <span style="color:rgb(200, 100, 000); font-style: italic">(<i>d-dp</i>(a)) model</span>: 
  In this scheme the Wannier orbitals are constructed as in the (<i>dp-dp</i>) model. However,
  in this scheme, one only supresses the screening inside <i>d</i>-like bands 
  ([[ucrpa]]=1).
  It is coherent with the fact that the DMFT will
  only be applied to the d orbitals: so the screening for Op-like bands need to be taken into account.
  <li> <span style="color:rgb(200, 100, 000); font-style: italic">(<i>d-dp</i>(b)) model</span>: It is the same model as the (<i>d-dp</i>(a)), nevertheless, in this case, only the weighting scheme is used ([[ucrpa]]=2 in ABINIT).
  </ul>
  
  Which way of computing interactions is the most relevant depends on
  the way the interactions will be used. Some aspects of it are discussed in Ref.
   [[Vaugier2012]].
  Also, for Mott insulators, and if self-consistency over interactions is carried out, the choice
  of models is discussed in [[Amadon2014]].
  
  
  <h4>3.2. The input file for cRPA calculation: correlated orbitals, Wannier functions </h4>
  <p> In this section, we will present the input variables and discuss how to extract useful information in the log file
  in the case of the <i>d-d</i> model.
  The input file for a typical cRPA calculation (tucrpa_1.in) contains four datasets (as usual GW calculations,
  see the <a href="lesson_gw1.html#1a">GW tutorial</a>):
  the first one is a well converged LDA calculation,  the second is non self-consistent calculation to
  compute accurately full and empty states, the third computes the constrained non interacting polarizability,
  and the fourth computes effective interaction parameters <i>U</i> and <i>J</i>.
  We discuss these four datasets  in the next four subsections.
  
  <p>
  Copy the files ../Input/tucrpa_2.in and
  ../Input/tucrpa_2.files in your Work directory.
  The input file tucrpa_2.in contains standard data to perform a LDA calculation on SrVO<SUB>3</SUB>. We focus
  in the next subsections on some peculiar input variables related to the fact that we perform a cRPA calculation.
  Before reading the following section, launch the abinit calculation:
  <pre>
  abinit < tucrpa_2.files > log_2
  </pre> 
  
  <h5>3.2.1. The first DATASET: A converged LDA calculation  </h5>
  
  The first dataset is a simple calculation of the density using LDA using 50 bands.
  We do not use symmetry in this calculation, so [[nsym]]=1.
  If symmetry is used ([[nsym]]=0), then the calculation of <i>U</i> and <i>J</i> will
  be valid, but the full interaction matrix described in
  section 3.2.4 will not be correct. 
  
  
  
  <h5>3.2.2. The second DATASET: A converged LDA calculation and definition of Wannier functions </h5>
  
  <p>
  Before presenting the input variables for this dataset, we discuss two important physical parameters
  relevant to this dataset.
  <p> 
  <ul> 
  <li><span style="color: #101010; font-style: italic; font-weight: 500"> Diagonalization of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian </span>: As in the case of DFT+DMFT or GW calculation,  a cRPA calculation requires that the LDA is perfectly converged and the
  Kohn Sham eigenstates are precisely determined , including
  the empty states. Indeed these empty states are necessary both to build Wannier functions and to compute the 
  polarizability.  For this reason we choose a very low value of
  [[tolwfr]]  
  in the input file tucrpa_1.in.
  
  <li> <span style="color: #101010; font-style: italic; font-weight: 500"> Wannier functions </span>: Once the calculation is converged, we compute Wannier functions, as in a DFT+DMFT calculation. To
  do this, we only precise that we are using the DFT+DMFT implementation (usedmft=0), but only with the Wannier keywords 
  ([[dmftbandi]] 
  and [[dmftbandf]]). 
  We emphasize that with respect to the discussion on models on section <a href="#3.1">3.1</a>, 
  [[dmftbandi]] 
  and [[dmftbandf]]  are used to define the so called A bands. We will see in dataset 2 how B bands are defined.
  In our case, as we are in the  <i>d-d</i> model, we choose only the <i>d</i>-like bands as a starting point 
  and [[dmftbandi]]  
  and [[dmftbandf]]  are thus equal to the first and last  <i>d</i>-like bands, namely 21 and 25.

  <h5>3.2.2. The third DATASET: Compute the constrained polarizability and dielectric function </h5>
  The third DATASET drives the computation of the constrained polarizability and the dielectric function.
  Again, we reproduce below the input variables peculiar to this dataset.
  
  <p> 
  We add some comments here on three most important topics
  <p> 
  <ul> 
  <li> <span style="color: #101010; font-style: italic; font-weight: 500">Definition of constrained polarizability</span>: 
  As in the discussion on models on section <a href="#3.1">3.1</a>,  the constrained polarizability is defined
  thanks to B-like bands. The keywords related to this definition is [[ucrpa_bands]]. According
  to the value of ucrpa, [[ucrpa_bands]] defined the bands for which the transitions are neglected, or (if ucrpa=2), it
  defined Wannier functions that are used in the weighting scheme (see Eq. (5) and (7) of section II of 
  [[Amadon2014]]). Alternatively
  and only if ucrpa=1, an energy windows can be defined (with variable [[ucrpa_window]]) to exclude the transition.
  In our case, as we are in the  <i>d-d</i> model, we neglect transitions
  inside the <i>d</i>-like bands, so we choose [[ucrpa_bands]]= 21 25.
  
  
  <li> <span style="color: #101010; font-style: italic; font-weight: 500">Convergence of the polarizability </span>: [[nband]] and  [[ecuteps]]  are the two main variables that should
  be converged. Note that one must study the role of these variables directly on the effective interaction parameters to
  determine their relevant values.
  
  <li> <span style="color: #101010; font-style: italic; font-weight: 500">Frequency mesh </span> of the polarizability: Can be useful if one wants to plot
  the frequency dependence of the effective interactions (as in e.g. [[Amadon2014]]).

  <h5>3.2.3. The fourth DATASET: Compute the effective interactions </h5>
  The fourth DATASET drives the computation of the effective interactions.
  It is similar computationally to the computation of exchange in <i>GW</i> calculations.
  Again, we reproduce below the input variables peculiar to this dataset.
  <p> 
  We add some comments on convergence properties
  <p> 
  <ul> 
  <li><span style="color: #101010; font-style: italic; font-weight: 500">  Convergence as the number of plane waves: </span>
  Eq. (A1) and (A2) in Appendix A of [[Amadon2014]] show
  the summation over plane waves which is performed. The cutoff on plane wave which is used in this summation is [[ecutsigx]]
  because of the similarity of Eq. A2 with the Fock exchange
  (see <a href="../../theory/generated_files/theorydoc_mbt.html#evaluation_gw_sigma">GW notes</a>)
  when one computes the bare interaction.
  [[ecutsigx]] is thus the main convergence parameter for this dataset.
  Note that as discussed in Appendix A of [[Amadon2014]], high values
  of [[ecutsigx]] can be necessary because
  oscillator matrix elements in PAW contains the Fourier transform of (a product of) atomic orbitals.

  <h5> 3.2.4 The cRPA calculation: the log file (for the <i>d-d</i> model) </h5>
  
  <p> We are now going to browse quickly the log file for this calculation.
  
  <ul> 
  <li> Bare interaction of atomic orbitals.
  
  <p> First, at the beginning of the log file,  you will find the calculation
  of the bare interaction for the atomic wavefunction corresponding the
  angular momentum specified by [[lpawu]], 
  in the input file (here [[lpawu]]
  =2).
  It is a simple fast direct integration.
  Note that this information is complete only if you use XML PAW atomic data
  (as the one available on the JTH table available on the ABINIT website).
  
  <pre>
   =======================================================================
    == Calculation of diagonal bare Coulomb interaction on ATOMIC orbitals
       (it is assumed that the wavefunction for the first reference
               energy in PAW atomic data is an atomic eigenvalue)
  
   Max value of the radius in atomic data file   =    201.3994
   Max value of the mesh   in atomic data file   =    910
   PAW radius is                                 =      2.2000
   PAW value of the mesh for integration is      =    587
   Integral of atomic wavefunction until rpaw    =      0.8418
  
   For an atomic wfn truncated at rmax =    201.3994
       The norm of the wfn is                    =      1.0000
       The bare interaction (no renormalization) =     17.7996 eV
       The bare interaction (for a renorm. wfn ) =     17.7996 eV
  
   For an atomic wfn truncated at rmax =      2.2000
       The norm of the wfn is                    =      0.8418
       The bare interaction (no renormalization) =     16.0038 eV
       The bare interaction (for a renorm. wfn ) =     22.5848 eV
   =======================================================================
  </pre> 
  
  Various quantities are computed, the one which is interesting to see here, is the bare interaction
  computed for a wavefunction truncated at a very large radius (here 201.3994 au ), ie virtually
  infinite. We find that this bare interaction is 17.8 eV. We will
  compare below this value to the bare interaction computed on Wannier orbitals.
  <p>
  
  <li> Bare Coulomb direct interaction of Wannier orbitals.
  
  In the third dataset, the code writes the Coulomb interaction matrix as:
  <pre>
    U'=U(m1,m2,m1,m2) for the bare interaction
   -      1      2      3      4      5

     5 15.715 15.092 15.114 15.092 16.567
  </pre>
  <ul> 
  <li> First we see that diagonal interactions are larger than off-diagonal terms, which is logical, because
  electron interaction is larger if electrons are located in the same orbital.
  <li>We recover in these interaction matrix the degeneracy of <i>d</i> orbitals in the cubic symmetry
  (we remind, as listed in [[dmatpawu]],
  that the order of orbitals in ABINIT are xy, yz, z2, xy, x2-y2). 
  <li> We note also
  that the interaction for <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i> and <i>e<SUB>g</SUB></i> orbitals are not the same. This effect is 
  compared in e.g. Appendix C.1 of [[Vaugier2012]] to
  the usual Slater parametrization of interaction matrices.
  <li> Diagonal bare interactions are smaller to the bare interaction on atomic orbitals (17.8 eV, as discussed above).
  It shows that the Wannier functions (obtained within the <i>d-d</i> model) are less localized than atomic orbitals. 
  It is logical because these Wannier functions contain indeed a weight on O-<i>p</i> orbitals.
  
  <li> From this interaction matrix, one can compute the average of all elements (the famous <i>U</i>), as well
  as the average of diagonal elements, which is sometimes used as another definition
  of <i>U</i> (see Eq. (8) and (9) of [[Amadon2014]]. The two quantities are written
  in the log file:
  </ul>
  <pre>
    Hubbard bare interaction U=1/(2l+1)**2 \sum U(m1,m2,m1,m2)=   15.3789    0.0000
  
   (Hubbard bare interaction U=1/(2l+1) \sum U(m1,m1,m1,m1)=   16.2514    0.0000)
  </pre>
  [To speed up the calculation and if one needs only these average values of <i>U</i> and <i>J</i>, one can use 
  [[nsym]]=0
  in the input file, but in this case, the interaction matrix
  does not anymore reproduce the correct symmetry. For several correlated atoms, the implementation is under test
  and it is mandatory to use 
  [[nsym]]=1.]
  <p>
  <li> Bare exchange interaction.
  The exchange interaction matrix is also written as well as the average of off-diagonal elements, which is <i>J</i>.
  <pre>
    Hund coupling J=U(m1,m1,m2,m2) for the bare interaction

 title: "Convergence studies"
 tag: convergence
 body: |
  We give here the results of some convergence studies, than can be 
  made by the readers. Some are computationally expensive. It
  is recommanded to use at least 32 processors. Input files are provided in tucrpa_3.in and tucrpa_3.files for the first case.

  <h4><a name="4.1">4.1</a> ecuteps </h4>
  The number of plane waves used in the calculation of the cRPA polarizability is
  determined by [[ecuteps]]
  (see <a href="../../theory/generated_files/theorydoc_mbt.html#RPA_Fourier_space">Notes on RPA calculations</a>).
  The convergence can be studied simply by increasing the values of [[ecuteps]] and gives:
  
  <pre>
     ecuteps (Ha)   U (eV)     J (eV)
        3            3.22       0.63
        5            3.01       0.60
        7            2.99       0.59
        9            2.99       0.58
  </pre>
  So, for [[nband]]=30, [[ecutsigx]]=30 and a 4x4x4 k-point grid,
  the effective interactions are converged with a precision of 0.02 eV for [[ecuteps]]=5.
  
  <h4><a name="4.2">4.2</a> nband </h4>
  The RPA polarizability depends also of the number of Kohn-Sham bands as
  also discussed in the <a href="../../theory/generated_files/theorydoc_mbt.html#RPA_Fourier_space">Notes on RPA calculations</a>.
  <pre>
     nband          U (eV)     J (eV)
      30             3.01       0.61
      50             2.75       0.60
      70             2.71       0.59
      90             2.70       0.59
  </pre>
  
  So, for [[ecuteps]]=5, [[ecutsigx]]=30 and a 4x4x4 k-point grid,
  the effective interactions are converged with a precision of 0.05 eV for [[nband]]=50.
  
  <h4><a name="4.3">4.3</a> ecutsigx  </h4>
  [[ecutsigx]] is
  the input variable determining the number of plane waves used in the calculation of
  the exchange part of the self-energy. The same variable is used here to determine the number
  of plane waves used in the calculation of the effective interaction. The study
  of the convergence gives:
  
  <pre>
       ecutsigx (Ha)            U_bare (eV)    J_bare (eV)      U (eV)       J (eV)
           30                    15.38          0.67            3.22         0.63
           50                    15.38          0.68            3.22         0.65
           70                    15.38          0.47            3.22         0.66
  </pre>
  For [[ecuteps]]=3, [[nband]]=30 and a 4 4 4 k-point grid, effective interactions are converged
  with a precision of 0.02 eV for [[ecutsigx]]=30 Ha.
  
  <h4><a name="4.4">4.4</a> k-point  </h4>
  The dependence of effective interactions with the k-point grid  is also
  important to check.
  <pre>
     kpoint grid     U_bare (eV)    J_bare (eV)     U (eV)       J (eV)
        4 4 4          15.38          0.65           3.22         0.63
        6 6 6          15.36          0.66           3.18         0.62
  </pre>
  
  For [[ecuteps]]=3, [[nband]]=30 and [[ecutsigx]]=30, effective interactions are converged to 0.01 eV for a
  k-point grid of 6 6 6.
  
  The converged parameters are thus [[ecuteps]]=5,[[ecutsigx]]=30,ngkpt=6 6 6, [[nband]]=50 with
  an expected precision of 0.1 eV.
  We will use instead [[ecuteps]]=5,[[ecutsigx]]=30,ngkpt=4 4 4, [[nband]]=50 to lower the computational cost.
  In this case, we find values of <i>U</i> and <i>J</i> of  2.75 eV and 0.41 eV and <i>U</i> is probably underestimated by 0.1 eV.

  In this section, we compute, using the converged values of parameters, the

  below gives for each model, the values
  of [[dmftbandi]], [[dmftbandf]]  and [[ucrpa_bands]]  that must be used, and it sums up

  Even if our calculation is not perfectly converged with respect to k-points,
  the results obtained for the
  <i>d-d</i>, <i>dp-dp</i>, and <i>d-dp (a)</i> models are  in agreement (within 0.1 or 0.2 eV) with results obtained
  in Table V of [[Amadon2014]] and references cited
  in this table.
  <p>
  To obtain the results with only the <i>t<SUB>2g</SUB></i>  orbitals, one must use a specific input file, which is tucrpa_4.in, which
  uses specific keywords, peculiar to this case (compare it with tucrpa_2.in). In this case, the value of J is extracted from the interaction matrices using the
  usual Slater Kanamori parametrization (see e.g. [[Lechermann2006]]) and not using the value of <i>J</i> computed in the code.)
  
  We now briefly comment the physics of the results.
  <ul> 
  <li> Bare interactions. When the number of bands used is larger, the Wannier orbitals extension is smaller. 
  Thus, the interaction
  obtained with Wannier functions obtained from <i>dp</i> bands are larger than interactions obtained with 
  Wannier functions obtained with <i>d</i> bands and also larger than interaction obtained on atomic orbitals.
  <li> For the same Wannier functions (<i>dp-dp, d-dp </i>(a), <i>d-dp</i> (b)), one can see the role of the screening on cRPA interactions:
  <ul> 
  <li> When one supresses all transitions inside the <i>d</i>-like and <i>p</i>-like bands (<i>dp-dp</i> model), <i>U</i> is large.
  <li> When only the transitions inside the <i>d</i>-like bands are suppressed, <i>U</i> is smaller (<i>d-dp</i> (a) model) in comparison
  to the <i>dp-dp</i> model, because the screening is more efficient.
  <li> Lastly, when one uses the  weighting scheme to compute the polarizability,<i> U</i> is very small. Indeed, in this case,
  one can show that there are some residual transitions  near the Fermi level (due to the hybridization between <i>d</i> orbitals and O<i>p</i> orbitals)
  which are very efficient to screen the interaction (A similar effect is discussed in
   [[Amadon2014]] for UO<SUB>2</SUB> or  
   [[Sakuma2013]] for transition metal oxydes).
  </ul>
  </ul>
  Finally, fully screened interactions (not discussed here) could also be computed for each definition
  correlated orbitals by using the default values of [[ucrpa_bands]] .

 title: "Frequency dependent interactions"
 tag: freq
 body: |
  In this section, we are going to compute frequency dependent effective interactions.
  Just change the following input variables in order to compute effective interaction between 0 and 30 eV.
  We use [[nsym]]=0
  in order to decrease the computational cost.
  <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:dotted gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .1em;padding:.1em .1em;">  <pre> <span style="color: #008800; font-style: italic"># -- Frequencies for effective interactions</span>
   nsym        0
   nfreqsp3   60
   freqspmax3 30 eV
   freqspmin3  0 eV
   nfreqsp4   60
   freqspmax4 30 eV
   freqspmin4  0 eV
  </pre></div>
  An example of input file can be found in tucrpa_5.in. Note that we have decreased some parameters
  to speed-up the calculations. Importantly, however, we have increased the number of Kohn Sham bands, because
  calculation of screening at high frequency involves high energy transitions which requires high
  energy states (as well as semicore states).
  
  If the calculation is too time consuming, you can reduce the number of frequencies. The following figure
  has been plotted with 300 frequencies, but using 30 or 60 frequencies is sufficient to see the 
  main tendencies.
  
  Extract the value of <i>U</i> for the 60 frequencies using:
  <pre>
  grep "U(omega)" -A 60 tucrpa_5.out > Ufreq.dat
  </pre>
  Remove the first line, and plot the data:
  <p align="center"> <img style="width: 634px" alt="dynamical" src="../documents/lesson_ucalc_crpa/dynamical.jpeg">
  </p>
  
  We recover in the picture the main results found in the Fig. 3 of [[Aryasetiawan2006]] . Indeed, the frequency
   dependent effective interactions exhibits a plasmon excitation.
