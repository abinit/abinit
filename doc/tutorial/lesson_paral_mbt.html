<h1>ABINIT tutorial, lesson on Many-Body calculations in parallel:</h1>
<h2>G<sub>0</sub>W<sub>0</sub> corrections in &alpha;-quartz SiO<sub>2</sub>. </h2>
<hr>
<p>This lesson aims at showing how to perform parallel calculations with the GW part of ABINIT. 
   We will discuss the approaches used to parallelize the different steps of a typical 
   G<sub>0</sub>W<sub>0</sub> calculation, and how to setup the parameters of the run in order to achieve good speedup.
   &alpha;-quartz SiO<sub>2</sub> is used as test case.
<!--
   To obtain the following physical properties of SiO<sub>2</sub>:
  <ul>
    <li>the RPA polarizability with the Adler-Wiser expression
    <li>the RPA polarizability with the Hilbert transform method
    <li>the quasi-particle (QP) corrections within the one-shot G<sub>0</sub>W<sub>0</sub> approximation
  </ul>
-->
  <p></p>
  It is supposed that you have some knowledge about UNIX/Linux, and you know how to 
  submit MPI jobs.</p>
<p>
This lesson should take about 1.5 hour and requires to have at least a 200 CPU core parallel computer.
<p>You are supposed to know already some basics of parallelism in ABINIT, explained in the tutorial
<a href="lesson_basepar.html">A first introduction to ABINIT in parallel</a>.
<p>
In the following, when "run ABINIT over nn CPU cores" appears, you have to use a specific command line according 
to the operating system and architecture of the computer you are using. 
This can be for instance: 

<pre>
mpirun -n nn abinit < abinit.files 
</pre>

or the use of a specific submission file.

</b>
The input files necessary to run the examples related to this tutorial are located
in the directory ~abinit/tests/tutoparal/Input.
<p>
Before beginning, you should create a working directory  whose name might be "Work_mbt" (so ~abinit/tests/tutoparal/Input/Work_mbt).
<p>
We will do most of the actions of this tutorial in this working directory.

<p><a name="WFK_gen"></a><br>
<h3><b>1 Generating the WFK file in parallel.</b> </h3>

<p>
In the <a href="lesson_gw1.html">first lesson</a> of the GW tutorial, we have learned how to 
generate the WFK file  with the sequential version of the code.
Now we will perform a similar calculation taking advantage of the k-point parallelism
implemented in the ground-state part.
<!--
Si0<sub>2</sub> in the alpha-quartz phase will be used as test case.
-->

<p>
First of all, you should copy the files file tmbt_1.files in the working directory Work_mbt:
<pre>
$ cd Work_mbt
$ cp ../tmbt_1.files . 
</pre>
<p>

The abinit files files is described in 
<a href="../users/abinit_help.html#intro1" target="helpsimg">section 1.1</a> of the abinit_help file. 
Please, read it now if you haven't done it yet!

<p>
Now open the input file ~abinit/tests/tutoparal/Input/tmbt_1.in in your preferred editor, and look
at its structure.
<p>
The first dataset performs a rather standard SCF calculation to obtain the ground-state density.
The second dataset reads the density file and calculates the Kohn-Sham band structure including many
empty states:

<pre>
# DATASET 2 : WFK generation
iscf2      -2      # NSCF
getden2    -1      # Read previous density
tolwfr2    1d-12   # Stopping criterion for the NSCF cycle.
nband2      160    # Number of (occ and empty) bands computed in the NSCF cycle.
nbdbuf2     10     # A large buffer helps to reduce the number of NSCF steps.
</pre>

<p>
We have already encountered these variables in the <a href="lesson_gw1.html">first lesson</a>
of the GW tutorial so their meaning should be familiar to you.
<p>
The only thing worth stressing is that this calculation solves the NSCF cycle
with the conjugate-gradient method (paral_kgb == 0)
<p>
The NSCF cycle is executed in parallel using the standard parallelism over k-points and spin in which the 
(<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nkpt" target="kwimg">nkpt</a> x
 <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nsppol" target="kwimg">nsppol</a>) blocks of bands are 
distributed among the nodes.
This test uses an unshifted 4x4x3 grid (48 k points in the full Brillouin Zone, folding to 9
k-points in the irreducible wedge) hence the theoretical maximum speedup is 9.

<p>
Now run ABINIT over nn CPU cores using

<pre>
(mpirun ...) abinit < tmbt_1.files >& tmbt_1.log &
</pre>

but keep in mind that, to avoid idle processors, the number of CPUs should divide 9.
At the end of the run, the code will produce the file tmbt_1o_WFK needed for the subsequent GW calculations.
<p>
With three nodes, the wall clock time is around 1.5 minutes.

<pre>
$ tail tmbt_1.out

-
- Proc.   0 individual time (sec): cpu=        209.0  wall=        209.0

================================================================================

 Calculation completed.
.Delivered    0 WARNINGs and   5 COMMENTs to log file.
+Overall time at end (sec) : cpu=        626.9  wall=        626.9
</pre>

<p>
A reference output file is given in ~tests/tutoparal/Refs, under the name tmbt_1.out.
<p>
Note that 150 bands are not enough to obtain converged GW results, you might increase the number 
of bands in proportion to your computing resources.

<h3>2. Computing the screening in parallel using the Adler-Wiser expression</b> </h3>

<p>
In this part of the tutorial, we will compute the RPA polarizability with the Adler-Wiser approach.
The basic equations are discussed in this <a href="theory_mbt.html#RPA_Fourier_space">section</a> of the GW notes.
<p>
First copy the files file tmbt_2.file in the working directory, 
then create a symbolic link pointing to the WFK file we have generated in the previous step:

<pre>
$ ln -s tmbt_1o_DS2_WFK tmbt_2i_WFK
</pre>

<!--
Before running the code in parallel, it is worth spending some time to analyze the input file ~abinit/tests/tutoparal/Input/tmbt_2.in.
-->
Now open the input file ~abinit/tests/tutoparal/Input/tmbt_2.in so that we can discuss its structure.
<p>
The set of parameters controlling the screening computation is summarized below:

<pre>
optdriver   3   # Screening run
irdwfk      1   # Read input WFK file
symchi      1   # Use symmetries to speedup the BZ integration
awtr        1   # Take advantage of time-reversal. Mandatory when gwpara=2 is used.
gwpara      2   # Parallelization over bands
ecutwfn     24  # Cutoff for the wavefunctions.
ecuteps     8   # Cutoff for the polarizability.
nband       50  # Number of bands in the RPA expression (24 occupied bands)
inclvkb     2   # Correct treatment of the optical limit.
</pre>

<p>
Most of the variables have been already discussed in the <a href="lesson_gw1.html">first</a> lesson
of the GW tutorial. The only variables that deserve some additional explanation are
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a> and 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#awtr" target="kwimg">awtr</a>.
<!--
The screening is computed for two frequencies (the static limit and an purely imaginary frequency)
hence this SCR file can only be used for performing GW calculations within the plasmon-pole approximation.
The number of planewaves in the screning 
(<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#ecuteps" target="kwimg">ecuteps</a>)
is already reasonable whereas the number of bands should be subject to converge tests (left to the user)
-->
<!--
<li><a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#symchi" target="kwimg">symchi</a></li>
-->
<!--
<p>
The value <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#symchi" target="kwimg">symchi</a>=1 
tells the program that we want to take advantage of the symmetry properties of the
oscillator matrix elements to reduce the number of k-points 
that have to be explicitly considered in the integrals over the BZ.
The set of independent k-points is defined  by the operations of the so-called little group of q, 
namely the symmetry operations whose rotational part leaves q unchanged within a reciprocal lattice vector.
As a consequence the computational gain depends on the symmetries of the external q-point. 
-->

<!--
Note that <b>awtr</b>=2 is the mandatory prerequisite for using the MPI algorithm corresponding to
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2, algorithm that is
documented
<p>
Here we just want to discuss some important technical details concerning
the implementation of the parallel algorithms used in the screening part
(<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargs.html#optdriver" target="kwimg">optdriver</a>=3).
<h4><a name="2a"></a></h4>
<h4><b> 2.a Adler-Wiser formula for the RPA polarizability.</b></h4>
<p>
Screening calculations are very CPU and memory demanding due to the large number of bande required to converge.
For this reason the code implements two different parallel algorithms, selected with the input variable 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>, 
that allow  a substancial descrease of the computational effort. 
Each method presents advantages and drawbacks that are extensively discussed in the documentation of the variable.
-->
<p>
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a> selects the parallel algorithm used to compute the screening.
Two different approaches are implemented:
<ul>
<li>
  <b>gwpara</b>=1 &rarr; Trivial parallelization over the k-points in the full Brillouin
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>gwpara</b>=2 &rarr; Parallelization over bands with memory distribution
</li>
</ul>

Each method presents advantages and drawbacks that are discussed in the documentation of the variable.
In this tutorial, we will be focusing on <b>gwpara</b>=2 since this is the algorithm with 
the best  MPI-scalability and, mostly important, it is the only one that allows for a significant reduction 
of the memory requirement.
<p>
The option <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#awtr" target="kwimg">awtr</a>=1 
specifies that the system presents time reversal symmetry so that it is possible
to halve the number of transitions that have to be calculated explicitly 
(only resonant transitions are needed).
Note that <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#awtr" target="kwimg">awtr</a>=1
is MANDATORY when <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2 is used.
<p>
Before running the calculation in parallel, it is worth discussing some important technical details of the implementation. 
For our purposes, it suffices to say that, 
when <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2 is used in the
screening part,  the code distributes the wavefunctions such that each processing unit 
owns the FULL set of occupied bands while the empty states are distributed among the nodes.
The parallel computation of the inverse dielectric matrix is done in three different steps that can 
be schematically described as follows:

<ol>
<li>
Each node computes the partial contribution to the RPA polarizability:

<p align="center"><img src=./lesson_paral_mbt/gwpara2_chi0.png></p>

</li>
<br>
<li>
The partial results are collected on each node. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
The master node performs the matrix inversion to obtain the inverse dielectric matrix and writes the final result on file.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Both the first and second step of the algorithm are expected to scale well with the number of processors.
Step 3, on the contrary, is performed in sequential thus it will have a detrimental effect 
on the overall scaling, especially in the case of large screening matrices
(large <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varint.html#npweps" target="kwimg">npweps</a> or large number of frequency points &omega;).
<p>
Note that the maximum number of CPUs that can be used is dictated by the number of empty states
used to compute the polarizability.
Most importantly, a balanced distribution of the computing time is obtained when the number of
processors divides the number of conduction states.
<!--
i.e. the difference between <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nband" target="kwimg">nband</a> and the number of valence bands.
-->
<p>
The main limitation of the present implementation is represented by the storage of the polarizability.
This matrix, indeed, is not distributed hence each node must have enough memory to store in 
memory a table whose size is given by (<b>npweps</b><sup>2</sup> x <b>nomega</b> x 16 bytes) where
<b>nomega</b> is the total number of frequencies computed.

<p>
Tests performed at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (see figures
below) have revealed that the first and the second part of the MPI algorithm have a very good scaling.
The routines cchi0 and cchi0q0 where the RPA expression is computed (step 1 and 2) scales 
almost linearly up to 512 processors.
The degradation of the total speedup observed for large number of processors is mainly due to the
portions of the computation that are not parallelized, namely the reading of the WFK file 
and the matrix inversion (qloop).

<p align="center"><img src=./lesson_paral_mbt/screening_speedup.png></p>

<p align="center"><img src=./lesson_paral_mbt/screening_rel_times_1000bands.png></p>
-->

<p>
At this point, the most important technical details of the implementation have been covered,
and we can finally run ABINIT over nn CPU cores using 

<pre>
(mpirun ...) abinit < tmbt_2.files >& tmbt_2.log &
</pre>

<p>
Run the input file tmb_2.in using different number of processors and keep track of the time for each processor number
so that we can test the scalability of the implementation.
The performance analysis reported in the figures above was obtained with PAW using ZnO as tests case, 
but you should observe a similar behavior also in SiO<sub>2</sub>.
<p>
Now let's have a look at the output results.
Since this tutorial mainly focuses on how to run efficient MPI computations,
we won't perform any converge study for SiO<sub>2</sub>. 
Most of the parameters used in the input files are already close to converge, only the k-point sampling 
and the number of empty states should be increased.
You might modify the input files to perform the standard converge tests
following the procedure described in the <a href="lesson_gw1.html">first lesson</a> of the GW tutorial.
<!--
calculate different SCR files with different values 
of <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nband" target="kwimg">nband</a>.
The SCR files can then be used to check the convergence of the QP corrections in the self-energy part.
We strongly suggest to use different input files since the calculations can be run independently 
and moreover one can easily tune the number of processors for each calculation in order to 
have a well balanced calculation.
this is left as useful excercise for the user.
-->
<p>
In the main output file, there is a section reporting how the bands are distributed among the nodes.
For a sequential calculation, we have

<p>
<pre>
 screening : taking advantage of time-reversal symmetry
 Maximum band index for partially occupied states nbvw =    24
 Remaining bands to be divided among processors   nbcw =    26
 Number of bands treated by each node ~   26
</pre>

The value reported in the last line will decrease when the computation is done with more processors.

<p>
The memory allocated for the wavefunctions scales with the number of processors.
You can use the grep utility to extract this information from the log file.
For a calculation in sequential, we have:
<pre>
$ grep "Memory needed" tmbt_2.log

  Memory needed for storing ug=         29.5 [Mb]
  Memory needed for storing ur=        180.2 [Mb]
</pre>

<i>ug</i> denotes the internal buffer used to store the Fourier components of the orbitals whose size
scales linearly with <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varint.html#npwwfn"  target="kwimg">npwwfn</a>.
<i>ur</i> is the array storing the orbitals on the real space FFT mesh. 
Keep in mind that the size of <i>ur</i> scales linearly with the total number of points in the FFT box,
number that is usually much larger than the number of planewaves 
(<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varint.html#npwwfn"  target="kwimg">npwwfn</a>).
The number of FFT divisions used in the GW code can be extracted from the main output file using
<pre>
$ grep setmesh tmbt_2.out  -A 1
 setmesh: FFT mesh size selected  =  27x 27x 36
          total number of points  =    26244
</pre>

As discussed in this <a href="theory_mbt.html#oscillator_notes">section</a> of the GW notes,
the Fast Fourier Transform represents one of the most CPU intensive part of the execution.
For this reason the code provides 
the input variable <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#fftgw" target="kwimg">fftgw</a> that 
can be used to decrease the number of FFT points for better efficiency.
The second digit of the input variable <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#gwmem" target="kwimg">gwmem</a>, 
instead, governs the storage of the real space orbitals and can used to avoid the storage of 
the costly array <i>ur</i> at the price of an increase in computational time.

<h4><a name="Mrgscr"></a></h4>
<h4><b> 2.d Manual parallelization over q-points.</b></h4>

<p>
The computational effort required by the screening computation scales linearly with the number of q-points.
As explained in this <a href="theory_mbt.html#RPA_Fourier_space">section</a> of the GW notes,
the code exploits the symmetries of the screening function so that only the irreducible Brillouin
zone (IBZ) has to be calculated explicitly.
On the other hand, a large number of q-points might be needed to achieve converged results.
Typical examples are GW calculations in metals or optical properties within the Bethe-Salpeter formalism.
<p>
If enough processing units are available, the linear factor due to the q-point sampling can be trivially 
absorbed by splitting the calculation of the q-points into several independent runs using the variables
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#nqptdm" target="kwimg">nqptdm</a> and
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#qptdm" target="kwimg">qptdm</a>.
The results can then be gathered in a unique binary file by means of the <b>mrgscr</b> utility 
(see also the automatic tests v3/t87, v3/t88 and v3/t89).

<h3>3. Computing the screening in parallel using the Hilbert transform method</b> </h3>


As discussed in the <a href="theory_mbt.html#RPA_Fourier_space">GW_notes</a>,
the algorithm based on the Adler-Wiser expression is not optimal when many frequencies are wanted. 
In this paragraph, we therefore discuss how to use the Hilbert transform method
to calculate the RPA polarizability on a dense frequency mesh.
The equations implemented in the code are documented in  <a href="theory_mbt.html#hilbert_transform">this section</a> of the GW notes.
<p>
As usual, we have to copy the files file tmbt_3.file in the working directory, and
then create a symbolic link pointing to the WFK file.

<pre>
$ ln -s tmbt_1o_DS2_WFK tmbt_3i_WFK
</pre>

The input file is ~abinit/tests/tutoparal/Input/tmbt_3.in.

Open it so that we can have a look at its structure.
<p>
A snapshot of the most important parameters governing the algorithm is reported below.

<pre>
gwcalctyp   2    # Contour-deformation technique.
spmeth      1    # Enable the spectral method.
nomegasf  100    # Number of points for the spectral function. 
gwpara      2    # Parallelization over bands
awtr        1    # Take advantage of time-reversal. Mandatory when gwpara=2 is used.
freqremax  40 eV # Frequency mesh for the polarizability
nfreqre    20
nfreqim     5
</pre>

<!--
The main difference is in the value used for
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#gwcalctyp" target="kwimg">gwcalctyp</a>, value that instructs the 
code to calculate the inverse dielectric matric for many frequencies both along the real and the imaginary axis.
The real frequency mesh is defined by
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#nfreqre" target="kwimg">nfreqre</a>, and
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#freqremax" target="kwimg">freqremax</a>,
while the sampling along the imaginary axis is specified by
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#nfreqim" target="kwimg">nfreqim</a>
(a more detailed discussion can be found in the <a href="lesson_gw2.html">second lesson</a> of the GW tutorial).
-->
<p>
The input file is similar to the one we used for the Adler-Wiser calculation.
The input variable <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#spmeth" target="kwimg">spmeth</a> enables the spectral method.
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#nomegasf" target="kwimg">nomegasf</a> 
defines the number of &omega;&prime;  points in the linear mesh used for the spectral function i.e. the number 
of &omega;&prime; in the 
<a href="theory_mbt.html#hilbert_transform">equation</a> for the spectral function.
<!--
The mesh is automatically calculated inside the code so that the entire set of resonant transitions is covered.

Note that <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#nomegasf" target="kwimg">nomegasf</a> 
should be subject to an accurate converge test since a dense sampling is required for an 
accurate representation of the delta function appearing in the expression for the spectral function.
-->
<p>
As discussed in the <a href="theory_mbt.html#hilbert_transform">GW notes</a>,
the Hilbert transform method is much more memory demanding that the Adler-Wiser approach,
mainly because of the large value of 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#nomegasf" target="kwimg">nomegasf</a> that is usually needed to converge the results.
Fortunately, the particular distribution of the data employed in <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2
turns out to be well suited for the calculation of the spectral function since each processor has to store and treat 
only a subset of the entire range of transition energies. 
The algorithm therefore presents good MPI-scalability since the number of &omega;&prime; frequencies that have to be stored 
and considered in the Hilbert transform decreases with the number of processors.
<!--
<p>
Choosing <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#nomegasf" target="kwimg">nomegasf</a> so that 
it is a multiple of the number of processors will facilitate the optimization of the 
Hilbert transform.
-->
<!--
An optimal distribution of both computing load and memory is achieved if 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2
is used since, by virtue of the particular distribution of the data, 
for example for calculating QP corrections 
with the countor deformation method or for obtaining the absorption spectrum withing the RPA.
-->
<p>
Now run ABINIT over nn CPU cores using

<pre>
(mpirun ...) abinit < tmbt_3.files >& tmbt_3.log &
</pre>

and test the scaling by varying the number of processors.

Keep in mind that, also in this case, the distribution of the computing work is well balanced when the number of CPUs divides 
the number of conduction states.

<p>
The memory needed to store the spectral function is reported in the log file:

<pre>
$ grep "sf_chi0q0" tmbt_3.log

the spectral representation.
TODO: Modify the code, Add a few more lines discussing the log.

The second line gives the memory needed to store the spectral function on this particular node.
Note, indeed, that the present implementation distributes bands and not transitions thus
each node has to treat a different number of &omega;&prime; points during the computation of the
spectral function.

The figure below shows the electron energy loss function (EELF) of SiO<sub>2</sub> calculated using the
Adler-Wiser and the Hilbert transform method. You might try to reproduce these results
(the EELF is reported in the file tmbt_3o_EELF, a much denser k-sampling is
required to achieve convergence).

<p align="center"><img src=./lesson_paral_mbt/comp-AW-spect.png></p>
<!--
<p>
Now there is an important question we should address:
how do we converge the number of bands used for evaluating the spectral function? Is this value
equal to the one that produces converged results when the standard implementation based on the
Adler-Wiser formula is used?
Strictly specking the answer is NO! The spectral method requires more bands to converge than the Adler-Wiser method. 
The reason is that the polarizability is obtained in terms of the Hilbert 
transform of the spectral function where the frequency integration extends up to infinity.
Due to the truncation in the number of bands, the tail of the spectral function is never evaluated exactly 
and this is equivalent to introducing a frequency cutoff in the Hilbert transform.
<p>
To check whether this frequency cutoff introduces important errors in the Hilber transform, we
can compare the QP corrections obtained with the spectral method versus analogus results obtained with 
a well converged Adler-Wiser calculation done on a reasonable k-mesh.
A less stringent tests would be to compare the macroscopic dielectric function obtained with the two methods 
assuming that also the other matrix elements of the dielectric matrix have the same convergence
behavior as the head (the macroscopic dielectric function).

<h3>4. Computing the one-shot GW corrections in parallel</b> </h3>

<p>
In this last paragraph, we discuss how to calculate G<sub>0</sub>W<sub>0</sub> corrections in parallel with 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2.
The basic equations used to compute the self-energy matrix elements are discussed in 
<a href="theory_mbt.html#evaluation_gw_sigma">this part</a> of the GW notes.
<p>
Before running the calculation, copy the files file tmbt_4.file in the working directory.
Then create two symbolic links for the SCR and the WFK file:

<pre>
ln -s tmbt_1o_DS2_WFK tmbt_4i_WFK
ln -s tmbt_2o_SCR     tmbt_4i_SCR
</pre>

Now open the input file ~abinit/tests/tutoparal/Input/tmbt_4.in.
<p>
The most important parameters of the calculation are reported below:

<pre>
optdriver   4            # Sigma run.
irdwfk      1  
irdscr      1
gwcalctyp   0 ppmodel 1  # G0W0 calculation with the plasmon-pole approximation.
#gwcalctyp  2            # Uncomment this line to use the contour-deformation technique but remember to change the SCR file!
gwpara      2            # Parallelization over bands.
symsigma    1            # To enable the symmetrization of the self-energy matrix elements.
ecutwfn    24            # Cutoff for the wavefunctions.
ecuteps     8            # Cutoff in the correlation part.
ecutsigx   20            # Cutoff in the exchange part.
nband       50           # Number of bands for the correlation part.
</pre>

For our purposes, it suffices to say that this input file defines a standard one-shot calculation 
with the plasmon-pole model approximation.
We refer to the  documentation and to the <a href="lesson_gw1.html">first lesson</a>
of the GW tutorial for a more complete description of the meaning of these variables.
<!--
<p>
The only parameter that is not treated in the GW tutorial and deserves some clarification  is 
<a href="vargw.html#symsigma">symsigma</a>.
The option <a href="vargw.html#symsigma">symsigma</a>=1 is used to enable 
the symmetrization of the self-energy  matrix elements.
In this case, the BZ integration defining the self-energy matrix elements is 
reduced to an appropriate irreducible wedge defined by the point group of the wave-vector k
specified in the <a href="vargw.html#kptgw">kptgw</a> list.
Similarly to the screening part, also here the computational gain depends on the symmetries of the external k-point. 
-->
<!--
Note that </b>symsigma</b>=1 is not compatible with self-consistent GW calculations.
Moreover, as discussed in the documentaion of the variable, this option should be 
used with particular care in the presence of accidental degeneracies.
-->
<!--
<p>
Here we are mainly interested in understading how to take advantage of the MPI algorithm
for our calculations.
The symmetrized expression leads to a considerable speedup of the run but, unfortunately,
this option is not yet compatible with self-consistent GW calculations 
(see <a href="vargw.html#gwcalctyp">gwcalctyp</a>).
<p>
The algorithm implemented in <a href="vargw.html#symsigma">symsigma</a>=1
constructs a symmetric invariant for the diagonal matrix elements of the self-energy 
by simply averaging the GW results within the degenerate subspace.
Therefore particular care has to be taken in the presence of accidental degeneracies.
since GW calculations performed with <a href="vargw.html#symsigma">symsigma</a>=1 won't be able to remove
the initial accidental degeneracy.
-->
<p>
Also in this case, we use <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2
to perform the calculation in parallel.
Note, however, that the distribution of the orbitals employed in the self-energy part 
significantly differs from the one used to compute the screening.
In what follows, we briefly describe the two-step procedure used to distribute the wavefunctions:
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Each node reads and stores in memory the states where the QP corrections are computed 
(the list of states specified by <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#kptgw" target="kwimg">kptgw</a> and 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#bdgw" target="kwimg">bdgw</a>). 
</li>
<br>
<li>
The <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nband" target="kwimg">nband</a> bands
are distributed using the following partition scheme:
<p align="center"><img src=./lesson_paral_mbt/band_distribution_sigma.png></p>

where we have assumed a calculation done with four nodes (the index in the box denotes the MPI rank).
</li>
<br>
</ol>

<p>
By virtue of the particular distribution adopted,
the computation of the correlation part is expected to scale well with the number CPUs.
The maximum number of processors that can be used is limited by
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varbas.html#nband" target="kwimg">nband</a>.

Note, however, that only a subset of processors will receive the occupied states when
the bands are distributed in step 2. 
As a consequence, the theoretical maximum speedup that can be obtained in the exchange part
is limited by the availability of the occupied states on the different MPI nodes involved in the run.
<p>
The best-case scenario is when the QP corrections are wanted for all the occupied states.
In this case, indeed, each node can compute part of the self-energy and almost linear scaling should be reached.
The worst-case scenario is when the quasiparticle corrections are wanted only for a few states (e.g.
band gap calculations) and N<sub>CPU</sub> &gt;&gt; N<sub>valence</sub>.
In this case, indeed, only  N<sub>valence</sub> processors will participate to the calculation of the exchange part.
<!--
As a consequence 
the computation of the matrix elements of the exchange part 
won't scale anymore when the number of processors exceeds the number of occupied bands.
Fortunately this part represents a minor fraction of the overall CPU time.

this meand that the computation of the exchange part 
<p>
<p>
First the code calculates the matrix elements of the exchange part then it proceeds to calculated
the more expected correlation part.
Each node owns the states for which the QP corrections will be calculated, then the nband bands 
are distributed.
We use alternating planes of bands to facilitate the calculation of the exchange part,
It's worth stressing that <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2
is also memory distributed since each node will keep in memory only the states 
needed to calculate the partial contribution to the final matrix element. 
-->
<p>
To summarize:
The MPI computation of the correlation part is efficient when the number of processors divides <b>nband</b>.
Optimal scaling in the exchange part is obtained only when each node possesses
the full set of occupied states.
<!--
stored when the list of states specified by 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#kptgw" target="kwimg">kptgw</a> and
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#bdgw" target="kwimg">bdgw</a>
-->

<p>
The two figures below show the speedup of the sigma part as function of the number of processors.
The self-energy is calculated for 5 quasiparticle states using nband=1024 (205 occupied states).
Note that this setup is close to the worst-case scenario.
The computation of the self-energy matrix elements (csigme) scales well up to 64 processors.
For large number number of CPUs, the scaling departs from the linear behavior
due to the unbalanced distribution of the occupied bands.
The non-scalable parts of the implementation (init1, rdkss) limit the total speedup due to Amdhal's law.

<!--
The overall scaling obtained with 512 processors is not satisfactory.
Of course the situation can be improved by using more complicate parallel algorithms 
and partitioning of the orbitals, but you should not blame the developers if the code
does not scale linearly up to thousand processors.
Before using a complicated MPI code, you should learn about the philosophy followed 
to parallelize the computation as well as its limitation.
Now you know that the number of processors in your MPI run have to be chosen carefully
according to the dimension of the proble.
The speedup curve reported in the graphic below tells you also that 
using more processors does not necessarily means getting results in less time.
-->
<p>
The implementation presents good memory scalability since the largest arrays are distributed. 
Only the size of the screening does not scale with the number of nodes.
By default each CPU stores in memory the entire screening matrix for all the q-points and frequencies 
in order to optimize the computation.
In the case of large matrices, however, it possible to opt for an out-of-core solution in which only a single
q-point is stored in memory and the data is read from the external SCR file  (slower but less memory demanding). 
This option is controlled by the first digit of <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#gwmem" target="kwimg">gwmem</a>.
<!--
Only the memory for the occupied states 
used for the exchange part won't scale with the number of processors.
This limitation is even more severe in the sigma part due to the additional factor <b>nqpt</b>
introduced by the BZ sampling.
-->
<p>
Now that we know how distribute the load efficiently, we can finally run the calculation using

<pre>
(mpirun ...) abinit < tmbt_4.files >& tmbt_4.log &
</pre>

Keep track of the time for each processor number so that we can test the scalability of the self-energy part.
<p>
Please note that the results of these tests are not converged.
A well converged calculation would require a 6x6x6 k-mesh to sample the full BZ, and a cutoff energy of 10 Ha 
for the screening matrix.
The QP results converge extremely slowly with respect to the number of empty states.
To converge the QP gaps within 0.1 eV accuracy, we had to include
1200 bands in the screening  and 800 states in the calculation of the self-energy.
<p>

The comparison between the LDA band structure and the G<sub>0</sub>W<sub>0</sub> energy bands of 
&alpha;-quartz SiO<sub>2</sub> is reported in the figure below.
The direct gap at &Gamma; is opened up significantly from the LDA value of 6.4 eV to about 9.5 eV when 
the one-shot G<sub>0</sub>W<sub>0</sub> method is used.
You are invited to reproduce this result 
(take into account that this calculation has been performed at the theoretical LDA parameters,
while the experimental structure is used in all the input files of this tutorial).

<h3><b>5. Basic rules for efficient parallel calculations:</b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
Remember that "Anything that can possibly go wrong, does" so, when writing your input file, try to "Keep It Short and Simple".
</li>
<br>
<li>
Do one thing and do it well:
<br>
Avoid using different values of <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargs.html#optdriver" target="kwimg">optdriver</a>
in the same input file.
Each runlevel employs different approaches to distribute memory and CPU time, hence
it is almost impossible to find the number of processors that will produce a balanced run in each dataset.

</li>
<br>
<li>
Prime number theorem:
<br>
Convergence studies should be executed in parallel only when the parameters that are tested do not interfere with the MPI algorithm.
For example, the convergence study in the number of bands in the screening should be 
done in separated input files when  <a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/varpar.html#gwpara" target="kwimg">gwpara</a>=2 is used.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Less is more:
<br>
Split big calculations into smaller runs whenever possible. 
For example, screening calculations can be split over q-points.
The calculation of the self-energy can be easily split over
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#kptgw">kptgw</a>  and 
<a href="../input_variables/html_automatically_generated/vargw.html#bdgw">bdgw</a>.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Look before you leap:
<br>
Use the converge tests to estimate how the CPU-time and the memory requirements depend on the
parameter that is tested. 
Having an estimate of the computing resources is very helpful when one has to launch the final
calculation with converged parameters.
