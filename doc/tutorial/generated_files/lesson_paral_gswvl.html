<h1>ABINIT tutorial. Parallelism for the ground state using wavelets :</h1>

<h2>Boron cluster, alkane.u</h2> 
 <hr>
<p>This lesson explains how to run the calculation of an isolated system
using a wavelet basis-set on a parallel computer using MPI. You will learn the
different characteristics of a parallel run using the wavelet basis-set and
test the speed-up on a small boron cluster of 14 atoms followed by a test on a
bigger alkane molecule.</p>
    <p>This lesson should take about 90 minutes and requires
      you have several CPU cores (up to 64). </p>
    <p>You are supposed to know already some basics of parallelism in ABINIT, explained in the tutorial
      <a href="lesson_basepar.html">A first introduction to ABINIT in parallel</a>.

    <h3><a name="0"></a>1. Wavelets variables and parallelism</h3>
    <p>The parallelism with the wavelet formalism can be used for two purposes: to reduce the memory load per node, or to reduce the overall computation time.</p>
    <p>The MPI parallelization in the wavelet mode relies on the orbital
distribution scheme, in which the orbitals of the system under investigation
are distributed over the assigned MPI processes. This scheme reaches its limit
when the number of MPI processes is equal to the number of orbitals in the
simulation. To distribute the orbitals uniformly, the number of processors must
be a factor (divisor) of the number of orbitals. If this is not the case, the
distribution is not optimal, but the code tries to balance the load over the
processors. For example, if we have 5 orbitals and 4 processors, the orbitals
will have the distribution: 2/1/1/1.</p>
    <p>There are no specific input variables to use the parallelism in the
wavelet mode as the only parallelisation level is on orbitals. So running
ABINIT with an <code>mpirun</code> command is enough (this command differs
according to the local MPI implementation) such as:</p>
    <pre>
mpirun -np Nproc abinit < infile > logfile
</pre>
    <p>For further understanding of the wavelet mode, or for citation purposes, one may read "<i>Daubechies wavelets as a basis set for density functional pseudopotential calculations</i>", L. Genovese, A. Neelov, S. Goedecker, T. Deutsch, S.A. Ghasemi, A. Willand, D. Caliste, O. Zilberberg, M. Rayson, A. Bergman et R. Schneider, J. Chem. Phys. <b>129</b>, 014109 (2008).<br></p>

    <h3><a name="1"></a>2. Speed-up calculation for a boron cluster</h3>
    <p>We propose here to determine the speed-up in the calculation of the
total energy of a cluster made of 14 boron atoms. Open the file
<code>tgswvl_01.in</code>. It contains first the definition of the wavelet
basis-set. One may want to test the precision of the calculation by varying the
<a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varbas.html#wvl_hgrid" target="_blank">wvl_hgrid</a>
and <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/vargs.html#wvl_crmult" target="_blank">wvl_crmult</a> variables.
This is not the purpose of this tutorial, so we will use the given values (0.45Bohr and 5).</p>
    <p>Run ABINIT with 3 processors. The overall time is printed at the end of the output file (and of the log):</p>
    <pre>
Proc.   0 individual time (sec): cpu=        172.6  wall=        172.6
</pre>
    <p>Read the output file to find the number of orbitals in the calculation (given by the keyword <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varbas.html#nband" target="_blank">nband</a>). With the distribution scheme of the wavelet mode, the best distribution over processors will be obtained for, 1, 3, 7 and 21 processors. Create four different directories (with the number of processors for instance) and run four times ABINIT with the same input file, varying the number of processors in {1, 3, 7, 21}. The speed-up is the ratio between the time with one processor and the time of a run with N processors.</p>
    <p>Assuming that the directories are called {01, 03, 07, 21}, one can grep the over-all time of a run and plot it in gnuplot with:</p>
    <pre>
plot "< grep 'individual time' */log | tr '/' ' '&quot; u 1:(ttt/$11) w lp t "Boron cluster", x t "Ideal speed-up"
</pre>
    <p>where <code>ttt</code> represents the time on one processor. The efficiency (in percent) of the parallelization process is the ratio between the speed-up and the number of processors. One can plot it with:</p>
    <pre>
plot &quot;< grep 'individual time' */log | tr '/' ' '&quot; u 1:(ttt/$11/$1*100) w lp t "Boron cluster"
</pre>
    <p>The first conclusion is that the efficiency is not so good when one use one orbital per processor. This is a general rule with the wavelet mode: due to the implementation, a good balance between speed and efficiency is obtained for two orbitals per processor. One can also see that the efficiency generally decreases with the number of processors.</p>
    <p>This system is rather small and the amount of time spent in the overhead (read the input file, initialise arrays...) is impacting the performance. Let's see how to focus on the calculation parts.</p>

    <h3><a name="2"></a>3. Time partition</h3>
    <p>The wavelet mode is generating a <code>time.prc</code> file at each run
(warning: it will erase any existing copy). This is a text file and can be read
directly. There are three sections, giving the time of the
initialisation process (before entering the SCF loop), the time of the SCF loop
itself, and the time for the post-processing. Let's have a closer look to the
SCF section (the actual figures will vary between runs and number of
processors):</p>
    <pre>
 CATEGORY          mean TIME(sec)       PERCENT
CrtLocPot                1.70E-01        0.018

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total CPU time for category: WFN_OPT = 9.22E+02  Total categorized percent  98.0
</pre>
    <p>With the total time of this SCF section, one can compute the speed-up and the efficiency of the wavelet mode more accurately:</p>
    <pre>
  N processors   Speed-up  Efficiency (%)
       3           2.3        75.3
       7           3.7        52.8
      21           7.5        35.6
</pre>
    <p>With the percentages of the <code>time.prc</code> file, one can see that, for this example, the time is mostly spent in the precondionner and the application of the local part of the Hamiltonian on the wavefunctions. Let's categorise the time information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The communication time is the sum of all the <code>_commun</code> entries and the <code>Un-TransComm</code> one.</li>
      <li>The time spent doing convolutions is the sum of <code>Precondition, ApplyLocPotKin, Rho_comput</code>.</li>
      <li>The linear algebra part is the sum of <code>GramS_comput, LagrM_comput</code>.</li>
      <li>The other entries are in a miscellaneous category.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By doing the summations, one can give the percentage per category during the SCF loop:
</p>
    <pre>
 CATEGORY       mean TIME(sec)       PERCENT
Communication       14.9               1.62
Convolutions       635.0              68.87
Linear algebra     204.4              21.17
Other               67.7               7.34
</pre>
    <p>You can analyse all the time.prc that have been generated for the different number of processors and see the evolution of the different categories.</p>

    <h3><a name="3"></a>4. Orbital parallelism and array parallelism</h3>
    <p>If the number of processors is not a divisor of the number of orbitals,
there will be some processors with fewer orbitals than others. This is not the
best distribution from an orbital point of view. But, the wavelet mode also
distributes the scalar arrays like density and potentials by z-planes in real space. So some
parts of the code may become more efficient when used with a bigger number of
processors, like the Poisson Solver part for instance.</p>
    <p>Run the boron example with {2, 4, 14, 15} processors and plot the speed-up. One can also look at the standard output to the load balancing of the Poisson Solver and the load balancing of orbitals (with 15 processors):</p>
    <pre>
[...]
 Processes from 0 to 9 treat 2 orbitals 
 Processes from 10 to 10 treat 1 orbitals 
 Processes from 11 to 14 treat 0 orbitals 
[...]
 Load Balancing for Poisson Solver related operations:
 LB_density        : processors   0  - 13 work at 100%
                     processor      14   works at  40%
  LB_kernel        : processors   0  - 12 work at 100%
                     processor      13   works at  92%
                     processors  14  - 14 work at   0%
</pre>
    <p>One can see that, as expected, the load balancing per orbital is bad (4
processors are doing nothing), but one can see also that the load balancing of
the scalar arrays is not so good since the last processor will have a reduced
array. It is thus useless to run this job at 15 processors, 14 will give the
same run time (since the load balancing will be better).</p>

    <h3><a name="4"></a>5. Speed-up calculation on a 65-atom alkane</h3>
    <p>Let's do the same with a bigger molecule and a finer grid. Open the file
<code>tgswvl_02.in</code>. It contains the definition of an alkane chain of 65
atoms, providing 64 orbitals. Run this input file with {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32,
48, 64} processors. The run with one processor should take less than one hour. If
the time is short, one can reduce <a href="../../input_variables/generated_files/varbas.html#wvl_hgrid" target="_blank">wvl_hgrid</a>
in the input file to 0.45.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align:center">
      <img src="../documents/lesson_paral_gswvl/speedup-C21.png" alt="Speedup for the C21H44 alkane chain" /> <img src="../documents/lesson_paral_gswvl/efficiency-C21.png" alt="Efficiency for the C21H44 alkane chain" /> <img src="../documents/lesson_paral_gswvl/time-C21.png" alt="Time repartition for the C21H44 alkane chain" />
      <p><small><i>Time measurements for a run over several processors of a C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>44</sub> alkane chain.</i></small></p>
    </div>

    <p>As we obtained previously, the efficiency is generally lowered when the number of processors is not a divisor of the number of orbitals (namely here 24 and 48).</p>

    <h3><a name="5"></a>6. Conclusion</h3>
    <p>With the wavelet mode, it is possible to efficiently decrease the run
time by increasing the number of processors. The efficiency is limited by the
increase of amount of time spent in the communications. The efficiency
increases with the quality of the calculation: the more accurate the
calculations are (finer hgrid...), the more efficient the code parallelization will be.</p>
