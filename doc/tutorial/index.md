# Welcome

## Overview of the ABINIT tutorials.

These tutorials are aimed at teaching the use of ABINIT, in the
UNIX/Linux OS and its variants (MacOS, AIX etc.).
They might be used for other operating systems, but the commands have to be adapted.

At present, nearly forty tutorials are available. Each of them is at most
two hours of student work. Tutorials 1-4 cover the basics, other lectures are
more specialized. There are dependencies between tutorials.
The following schema should help you to understand these dependencies.

The base tutorials are presented at the top, in orange. The blocks in red represents additional tutorials related
to ground-state features. Response-function features are explained
in the tutorials in the light brown blocks. Finally, the Many-Body Perturbation Theory
capabilities are demonstrated in the tutorials belonging to the dark brown blocks.
The right-hand side blocks gather the tutorials related to the parallelism inside ABINIT.

Visualisation tools are NOT covered in the ABINIT tutorials.
Powerful visualisation procedures have been developed in the Abipy context,
relying on matplotlib. See the README of [Abipy](https://github.com/abinit/abipy)
and the [Abipy tutorials](https://github.com/abinit/abitutorials).

Before following the tutorials, you should have read the [new user's guide](/guide/new_user),
as well as the pages
1045-1058 of [[cite:Payne1992|Rev. Mod. Phys. 64, 1045 (1992)]].
If you have more time, you should browse through the Chaps. 1 to 13, and appendices L and M of the book
[[cite:Martin2004|this book]] by R. M. Martin.
The latter reference is a must if you have not yet used another electronic structure code or a Quantum Chemistry package.

After the tutorial, you might find it useful to learn about the test cases
contained in the subdirectories of ~abinit/tests/, e.g. the directories fast,
v1, v2, ... , that provide many example input files.
You should have a look at the README files of these directories.

### Tutorials on basic concepts

* [The compilation howto tutorial](compilation) explains how to compile ABINIT from source 
  including the external libraries. 
  More advanced topics such as using **modules** in supercomputing centers,
  compiling and linking with the **intel compilers** and the **MKL library** as well as **OpenMP threads** 
  are also discussed.

**The tutorials 1-4 present the basic concepts, and form a global entity: you

For each of these tutorials, you are supposed to be familiarized with the
corresponding tutorial for the sequential calculation.**

    One simple example of parallelism in ABINIT will be shown.

  * [Parallelism for ground-state calculations, with plane waves](paral_gspw) presents the combined

    e.g. the "KGB" parallelism for force calculations.

  * [Parallelism for ground-state calculations, with wavelets](paral_gswvl) presents the parallelism of ABINIT,
    when wavelets are used as a basis function instead of planewaves, for the computation
    of total energy, density, and ground state properties

   of response properties within ABINIT, see the tutorial [DFPT 1 (RF1)](rf1)

  * [Parallelism of Many-Body Perturbation calculations (GW)](paral_mbt) allows to speed up
    the calculation of accurate electronic structures (quasi-particle band structure, including many-body effects).
