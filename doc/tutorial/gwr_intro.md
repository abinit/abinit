# An overview of the GWR code

This page provides a quick introduction to the new GWR driver of ABINIT
We discuss the technical details related to the implementation, the associated input variables.
as well as the pros and cons with respect to the conventional GW implementation formulated
in Fourier-space and frequency domain.

## Why a new GW code?

The conventional GW algorithm has quartic scaling with the number of atoms whereas GWR scales cubically.
The legacy GW code obtains the matrix elements of self-energy by performing a convolution in frequency domain, 
usually within the plasmon-pole approximation whereas GWR computes the self-energy elements in 
imaginary-time 

Select the task to be performed when [[optdriver]] == 6 i.e. GWR code.
while [[gwr_task]] defines the task

### Requirements

* Scalapack
* Optmized FFT libraries (FFTW3 or MKL-DFTI)

Discuss single and double precision version. 
We recall that single-precision is the default

## Formalism

The zero-temperature Green's function in the imaginary-time domain is given by:

\begin{equation}
G(\rr, \rr', i\tau) = 
\Theta(\tau) \Gove(\rr, \rr', i\tau) +
\Theta(-\tau) \Gund (\rr, \rr', i\tau) 
\end{equation}

with $\Theta$ the Heaviside step-function and 

\begin{equation}
\Gove(\rr, \rr', i\tau) =
-\sum_n^{\text{unocc}} \psi_n(\rr)\psi_n^*(\rr') e^{-\ee_n\tau}
\qquad (\tau > 0)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Gund(\rr, \rr', i\tau) = 
\sum_n^{\text{occ}} \psi_n(\rr)\psi_n^*(\rr') e^{-\ee_n\tau}
\qquad (\tau < 0)
\end{equation}

For simplicity we have assumed a spin-unpolarized semiconductor with scalar wavefunctions
and the Fermi level $\mu$ has been set to zero.

The GWR code constructs the Green's function from the KS wavefunctions and eigenvalues stored 
in the WFK file specified via [[getwfk_filepath]] ([[getwfk]] in multi-dataset mode).
This WFK file is usually produced by performing a NSCF calculation including empty states and the GWR driver
provides a specialized option to perform a direct diagonalization of the KS Hamiltonian in parallel with Scalapack.
(see section below)
When computing $G^0$, the number of bands included in the sum over states is controlled by [[nband]].
Clearly, it does not make any sense to ask for more bands than the ones available in the WFK file. 

The imaginary axis is sampled using a minimax mesh with [[gwr_ntau]] points.
The other piece of information required for the selection of the minimax mesh 
is the ratio between the fundamental gap and the maximum transition energy i.e. 
the differerence between the highest KS eigenvalue for empty states that clearly depends 
on [[nband]] and the energy of the lowest occupied state.

Note that only $\Gamma$-centered $\kk$-meshes are supported in GWR, e,g:

* [[ngkpt]] 4 4 4
* [[nshiftk]] 1 
* [[shiftk]] 0 0 0 

The cutoff energy for the polarizability is given by [[ecuteps]]
while [[ecutsigx]] defines the number of g-vectors for the exchange part of the self-energy.

Note that GWR also needs the GS density produced by a previous GS SCF run.
This file can be read via [[getden_filepath]].


\begin{equation}
\chi(\rr,\RR', t) = G(\rr,\RR', i\tau) G^*(\rr,\RR', -i\tau)
\end{equation}

As concerns the treatment of the long-wavelenght limit, we have the following input variables:

[[inclvkb]], [[gw_qlwl]], [[gwr_max_hwtene]]


## GWR workflow for QP energies

A typical GWR workflow with arrows denoting dependencies between the different steps
is schematically represented in the figure below:

In order to perform a standard one-shot GW calculation one has to:

  1. Run a converged ground state calculation to obtain the density.

  2. Perform a non self-consistent run to compute the KS eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions
     including several empty states. Note that, unlike standard band structure calculations,
     here the KS states *must* be computed on a regular grid of **k**-points.

  3. Use [[optdriver]] = 3 to compute the independent-particle susceptibility $\chi^0$ on a regular grid of
     **q**-points, for at least two frequencies (usually, $\omega=0$ and a purely imaginary
     frequency - of the order of the plasmon frequency, a dozen of eV).

The Green's function is constructed from the KS wavefunctions and eigenvalues stored in the WFK file
hence the 

The following physical properties can be computed:

* Imaginary part of ph-e self-energy in metals (**eph_task 1**) that gives access to:

    * Phonon linewidths induced by e-ph coupling

* Real and imaginary parts of the e-ph self-energy (**eph_task 4**) that gives access to:

    * Zero-point renormalization of the band gap

At the time of writing, the following features are **not yet supported** in GWR:

* PAW calculations
* Spinors ([[nspinor]] = 2)
