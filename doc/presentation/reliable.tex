How to secure existing capabilities despite heavy
development efforts and the associated bug generation ?

\vskip 2em
More than 500 automatic tests have been set up.
\vskip 1em
\begin{itemize}
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  in general, each last a dozen of seconds on a PC, or less
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  they examine ``all'' capabilities of ABINIT
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  the output is automatically compared to a reference file
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  PERL scripts drive the procedure
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  these tests can be used as examples for beginners
 \item[\red \ding{229}]
  portability concerns have been solved (see next slide)
\end{itemize}
\vskip 1em
The analysis of output files is {\red multilevel} :
\begin{itemize}
 \item
  for each test a few lines are produced if everything went right,
  and these are summarized in a unique file for each batch of 100 tests
 \item
  if there is a problem, a ``diff'' file can be consulted, for each test
 \item
  a detailed ``log'' file contains specific error handling messages,
  for each test
\end{itemize}
