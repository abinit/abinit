\chapter{The \textit{configure} script}

\section{Running configure}

Autoconf is a tool producing a shell script that automatically configures
software source code to adapt to many kinds of environments. \textbf{The
configuration script produced by Autoconf is independent of Autoconf
when it is run, so that its users do not need to install Autoconf}.
In other words: you do not need have Autoconf installed to build ABINIT.
Moreover this configuration script requires no manual user intervention
when run; it do not normally even need an argument specifying the
system type. Instead, it individually tests for the presence of each
feature that the software package it is tuned to might need. However
it does not yet have paranormal powers, and in particular has no access
to what you have in mind. You still have to explicitely interact with
it for now, and the best way to do it is through the numerous options
of this \textit{configure} script. \\


One highly-recommended step is to create a build directory and go
there before running configure:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir tmp-build && cd tmp-build
\end{verbatim}

In the following, we will assume that you have done so.\\


If you run it without arguments, the \textit{configure} script will
do its best to detect the components of your computer and development
environment automatically. It is however possible to tune its behavior
through the use of two classes of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item command-line options, composed of triggers (\textit{enable/disable})
and specifiers (\textit{with/without}), plus a few special options; 
\item environment variables, which influence the overall behaviour of the
script. 
\end{itemize}
A typical call looks like:\begin{verbatim}
    ../configure [OPTION] ... [VAR=VALUE] ...
\end{verbatim}Here is what {[}OPTION{]} stands for:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{7cm}|}
\hline 
\textbf{Type ...}  & \textbf{if you want to ...} \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{-{-}enable-FEATURE{[}=ARG{]}}  & activate FEATURE {[}ARG=yes{]} \tabularnewline
\texttt{-{-}disable-FEATURE}  & do not activate FEATURE (same as \hbox{-{-}enable-FEATURE}=no) \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{-{-}with-PACKAGE{[}=ARG{]}}  & use PACKAGE {[}ARG=yes{]} \tabularnewline
\texttt{-{-}without-PACKAGE}  & do not use PACKAGE (same as \hbox{-{-}with-PACKAGE}=no) \tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

To assign environment variables (e.g., CPP, FC, \ldots{}), you specify
them as \texttt{VAR=VALUE} couples on the command line. Please note
that there must be no spaces around the '=' sign. Moreover, \texttt{VALUE}
must be quoted when it contains spaces. If some assignements are ignored
by the configure script, just try the other way around:\begin{verbatim}
    VAR=VALUE ... ./configure [OPTION] ...
\end{verbatim}

In this chapter, the defaults for the options are specified in square
brackets. No brackets means that there is no default value.


\section{Environment variables}

In table \ref{tab:env-summary}, you will find short descriptions
of the most useful variables recognized by the configure script of
ABINIT. Use these variables to override the choices made by \texttt{configure}
or to help it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.
Please note that they always have precedence over command-line options.

\caption{Influencial environment variables for the build system of ABINIT.}


\label{tab:env-summary} 
\end{table}


There are 2 environment variables of critical importance to the build
system, though they cannot be managed by \textit{configure}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{PATH}, which defines the order in which the compilers will
be found, and the number of hits; 
\item \textit{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}, which will greatly help the build system
find usable external libraries, in particular MPI. 
\end{itemize}
Improper settings of these 2 variables may cause a great confusion
to the configure script in some cases, in particular when looking
for MPI compilers and libraries. A typical issue encountered is the
following crash:{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
checking for gcc... /home/pouillon/hpc/openmpi-1.2.4-gcc4.1/bin/mpicc
checking for C compiler default output file name... a.out
checking whether the C compiler works... configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.
If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.
See `config.log' for more details.
\end{verbatim}
}And a look at config.log shows:{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
...
configure:6613: checking whether the C compiler works
configure:6623: ./a.out ./a.out: error while loading shared libraries:
libmpi.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
configure:6626: $? = 127
configure:6635: error: cannot run C compiled programs.
...
\end{verbatim}
}

This kind of error results from a missing path in the \textit{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}
environment variable, and can be solved very easily, in the present
case this way:{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/pouillon/hpc/openmpi-1.2.4-gcc4.1/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" \end{verbatim}
}in the case of a BASH shell, and by:{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/home/pouillon/hpc/openmpi-1.2.4-gcc4.1/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" \end{verbatim}
}for a C shell.


\section{The configuration process}

Configuring ABINIT is a delicate step-by-step process, because each
component is interacting permanently with most others. This is reflected
in the output of \textit{configure}, that we describe in this section.\\


The process starts with an overall startup, where the basic parameters
required by Autoconf and Automake are set. During the second part
of this step, the build system of ABINIT reads the options from the
command line and from a config file, making sure that the environment
variables will always have precedence over the command-line options,
which in turn override the options read from the config file. It then
reports about changes in the user interface of the build system, warning
the user if they have used an obsolete option.\\


The next step is about ensuring the overall consistency of the options
provided to configure. The build system takes the necessary decisions
so that the code may be built safely. It then parses the options,
and issues an error if the user has provided invalid options. The
error messages give all the information needed to fix the problems.\\


Then comes the MPI startup stage, which the first half of the configuration
of MPI support. This must happen \textbackslash{}underline\{before\}
any Autoconf compiler test, in order to give the build system the
possibility to consistently select the MPI compilers that have been
detected. This step is mandatory to avoid configuration issues later
on, due to mismatches between the sequential and parallel compilers.\\


The next step is to find the various utilities that the build system
may need along the rest of the configuration process. This runs usually
very smoothly, since these tools are found on most of the platforms
ABINIT runs on.\\


The preprocessing step is where serious things really start. The C
preprocessor is searched for, which involves in turn the search for
a working C compiler. At this point, all compilers must already have
been selected. This is also typically where \textit{configure} may
crash if the MPI installation detected is broken or misconfigured
(see \textquotedbl{}Environment variables\textquotedbl{} section within
this chapter), because the C compiler will not be able to produce
executables. This is why MPI support is disabled by default, and we
are open to any suggestion.\\


The three next steps involve the search for suitable C, C++ and Fortran
compilers, the detection of their type, and the application of tricks
to have them work properly on the user's platform. These are also
stages where the configuration may fail, in particular if no suitable
Fortran compiler is found.\\


Then the build system configures the use of the archiver, to build
the numerous libraries that are part of ABINIT.\\


The two next steps are about fine-tuning the compile flags so that
the build will work fine if the architecture is 64-bit (work still
in progress), and to set the adequate level of optimization according
to the platform parameters identified so far.\\


Here comes the probably most critical step of the configuration: MPI
support. If everything could be set during the MPI startup stage,
no further test is performed, and the parallel code is marked for
building. If not, the build system will try to detect whether the
compilers are able to build MPI source code and set the MPI options
accordingly.\\


Once all this is done, the build system can set the parameters for
the linear algebra and FFT libraries (work still in progress), before
turning to the connectors (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cfg-connectors}).\\

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=15cm]{connectors}}
  \caption{Dependency diagram of the connectors.}
  \label{fig:cfg-connectors}
\end{figure}

One last configuration step is dedicated to the nightly build support,
which is now working but still at an early stage of development.\\


The very last step is to output the configuration to the numerous
makefiles, as well as to a few other important files. At the end,
a warning is issued if the Fortran compiler in use is known to cause
trouble.


\section{Options provided by Autoconf}

Every \textit{configure} script generated by Autoconf provides a basic
set of options, whatever the package and the environment. They either
give information on the tunable parameters of the package or influence
globally the build process. In most cases you will only need a few
of them, if any. \\


Overall configuration:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|rl|l|}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

By default, \texttt{make install} will install all the files in subdirectories
of \textit{/opt/abinit/$<$version$>$}. You can specify an installation
prefix other than \textit{/opt} using \texttt{\hbox{-{-}prefix}},
for instance \texttt{\hbox{-{-}prefix=\$HOME}}. \\

\par\end{center}

The following sections describe Abinit-specific options.


\section{Compiler options}


\subsection{Debugging}

The build system of Abinit provides a comprehensive database of debugging
flags, covering all supported compiler vendors, compiler versions
and architectures. They can be accessed when using the \textit{profile}
debugging mode of the build system, which is enabled when the \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-debug}}
option is neither set to {}``yes'' nor {}``no''. The profile mode
offers 4 different optimization levels, controlled by the value of
the\textit{ \hbox{-{-}enable-debug}} option: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{basic};
\item \textit{enhanced};
\item \textit{paranoid};
\item \textit{naughty}.
\end{itemize}
The default level is \textit{basic}, which corresponds to the setting
of minimal compiler-dependent debugging flags, typically {}``\textit{-g}''.
The \textit{enhanced} level add checks for the most common bad programming
practices, while the \textit{paranoid} level covers a much broader
range of mistakes. The \textit{naughty} level should be used by developers
only, since it tries to make the build fail. It is important to note
that these debugging levels are strictly ordered and cumulative. This
means e.g. that setting \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-debug=paranoid}}
will also apply the flags from the \textit{basic} and \textit{enhanced}
levels.\\


When \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-debug=yes}}, the build system expects
debugging parameters from the command line. Compile flags may be specified
through the \textit{CFLAGS\_DEBUG} (C programs), \textit{CXXFLAGS\_DEBUG}
(C++ programs) and \textit{FCFLAGS\_DEBUG} (Fortran programs) environment
variables. Link flags may be provided through \textit{CC\_LDFLAGS\_DEBUG}
(C programs), \textit{CXX\_LDFLAGS\_DEBUG} (C++ programs) and \textit{FC\_LDFLAGS\_DEBUG}
(Fortran programs). Linking additional libraries should be done through
\textit{CC\_LIBS\_DEBUG} (C programs), \textit{CXX\_LIBS\_DEBUG} (C++
programs) and \textit{FC\_LIBS\_DEBUG} (Fortran programs).\\


When \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-debug=no}}, the debugging features
of the build system are completely silenced and the above environment
variables are ignored.


\subsection{Optimization}

The build system of Abinit provides a comprehensive database of optimization
flags, covering all supported compiler vendors, compiler versions
and architectures. They can be accessed when using the \textit{profile}
optimization mode of the build system, which is enabled when the \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-optim}}
option is neither set to {}``yes'' nor {}``no''. The profile mode
offers 3 different optimization levels, controlled by the value of
the\textit{ \hbox{-{-}enable-optim}} option: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{safe}; 
\item \textit{standard}; 
\item \textit{aggressive}.
\end{itemize}
These names are self-explanatory, and the default is of course \textit{standard},
which corresponds to the optimization database present in version
4 of Abinit, extended and updated. The \textit{safe} level may be
quite convenient when the build fails at the standard level, due to
bugs in the compilers. It is obvious that the \textit{aggressive}
level should be used with extreme care, and systematically accompanied
by a run of the whole test suite before any production calculation.\\


When \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-optim=yes}}, the build system expects
optimization parameters from the command line. Compile flags may be
specified through the \textit{CFLAGS\_OPTIM} (C programs), \textit{CXXFLAGS\_OPTIM}
(C++ programs) and \textit{FCFLAGS\_OPTIM} (Fortran programs) environment
variables. Link flags may be provided through \textit{CC\_LDFLAGS\_OPTIM}
(C programs), \textit{CXX\_LDFLAGS\_OPTIM} (C++ programs) and \textit{FC\_LDFLAGS\_OPTIM}
(Fortran programs). Linking additional libraries should be done through
\textit{CC\_LIBS\_OPTIM} (C programs), \textit{CXX\_LIBS\_OPTIM} (C++
programs) and \textit{FC\_LIBS\_OPTIM} (Fortran programs).\\


When \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-optim=no}}, the optimization features
of the build system are completely silenced and the above environment
variables are ignored. Please note that debugging has precedence over
optimization, and that the latter is disabled for all debugging levels
above \textit{basic}.


\subsection{Hints}

Abinit is a complex project, embedding the source code of other projects
as well. In order to be successful, the builds require \textit{hints}
in addition to the other flags. The build system of Abinit thus provides
a comprehensive database of optimization flags, covering all supported
compiler vendors, compiler versions and architectures. This is the
purpose of the \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-hints}} option, which
defaults to {}``yes''. It is extremely recommend to keep it so.\\


However, there are cases where even the build system is not able to
provide sufficient information for a successful build. It can thus
be complemented by extra information from the command line. Compile
flags may be specified through the \textit{CFLAGS\_EXTRA} (C programs),
\textit{CXXFLAGS\_EXTRA} (C++ programs) and \textit{FCFLAGS\_EXTRA}
(Fortran programs) environment variables. Link flags may be provided
through \textit{CC\_LDFLAGS\_EXTRA} (C programs), \textit{CXX\_LDFLAGS\_EXTRA}
(C++ programs) and \textit{FC\_LDFLAGS\_EXTRA} (Fortran programs).
Linking additional libraries should be done through \textit{CC\_LIBS\_EXTRA}
(C programs), \textit{CXX\_LIBS\_EXTRA} (C++ programs) and \textit{FC\_LIBS\_EXTRA}
(Fortran programs).


\subsection{64-bit architectures}

Most 64-bit architectures do not require specific flags for successful
builds. However, in some situations, in particular on hybrid 32/64-bit
systems, it is necessary to add such flags to select the proper binary
object format. In these cases, you may want to use the \textit{\hbox{-{-}enable-64bit-flags}}
option, in particular if you encounter link-time and/or run-time problems.\\


Please note that the support for 64-bit architectures is still incomplete
and will be reworked during the next development cycle of ABINIT.


\subsection{Overriding the build-system settings}

In some extremely rare configurations, the build system is not able
to set properly the build parameters. Should this happen, you can
override all build-system settings by directly providing the flags
from the command line. Compile flags may be specified through the
\textit{CFLAGS} (C programs), \textit{CXXFLAGS} (C++ programs) and
\textit{FCFLAGS} (Fortran programs) environment variables. Link flags
may be provided through \textit{CC\_LDFLAGS} (C programs), \textit{CXX\_LDFLAGS}
(C++ programs) and \textit{FC\_LDFLAGS} (Fortran programs). Linking
additional libraries should be done through \textit{CC\_LIBS} (C programs),
\textit{CXX\_LIBS} (C++ programs) and \textit{FC\_LIBS} (Fortran programs).\\


If you had to that, please report a bug to \href{https://bugs.launchpad.net/abinit/+filebug}{https://bugs.launchpad.net/abinit/+filebug},
providing as much information as you can on the architecture, including
and the compiler, including how to get the version number of the compiler
on the command line and the output of this command. We will add support
for your case as soon as we can.


\section{MPI options}

In addition to serial optimization, ABINIT provides parallel binaries
relying upon the MPI library. If you do not know what MPI stands for,
then you \underbar{really} need the help of a computer scientist before
reading this section. First let us make clear that we cannot provide
you with any support to install MPI. If you need to do it, we advise
you to ask help to your system and/or network administrators, because
it will likely require special permissions and fair technical skills.
In many cases you will already have a working installation of MPI
at your disposal, and will at most need some information about its
location.\\


Providing extended support for MPI is extremely delicate: there is
no standard location for the package, there are concurrent implementations
following different philosophies, and Fortran support is compiler-dependent.
Moreover, there might be several versions of MPI installed on your
system, and you have to choose one of them carefully. In particular,
if you want to enable the build of parallel code in ABINIT --- which
you will likely do --- you have to build ABINIT with the same Fortran
compiler that has been used for MPI.\\


The MPI options provided by the build system are summarized in the
following table.\\


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline 
\textbf{Option}  & \textbf{Description} \tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{-{-}enable-mpi}  & Enable MPI support\tabularnewline
\texttt{-{-}enable-mpi-io}  & Enable parallel I/O {[}default=no{]}\tabularnewline
\texttt{-{-}enable-mpi-trace}  & Enable MPI time tracing {[}default=no{]}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{-{-}with-mpi-prefix=PATH}  & Prefix for the MPI installation\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{-{-}with-mpi-level=NUMBER} & MPI implementation level (1 or 2)\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{-{-}with-mpi-includes=FLAGS}  & MPI include flags\tabularnewline
\texttt{-{-}with-mpi-libs=LIBS}  & MPI libraries to append at the link stage\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{-{-}with-mpi-runner=PROG}  & Full path to the MPI runner program\tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

If \hbox{-{-}enable-mpi} is left unset, there are 2 ways of enabling
the build of parallel binaries: either by using the \hbox{-{-}with-mpi-prefix}
option, or by specifying MPI-capable compilers from the command line,
through the CC (C compiler), CXX (C++ compiler) and FC (Fortran compiler)
environment variables. Please note that you have to specify \hbox{-{-}with-mpi-runner}
manually in the latter case.\\


If \textquotedbl{}-{-}enable-mpi\textquotedbl{} is set to \textquotedbl{}yes\textquotedbl{},
the parallel code will be built only if a usable MPI implementation
can be detected. If the \textquotedbl{}-{-}with-mpi-prefix\textquotedbl{}
option is provided, \textit{enable\_mpi} is automatically set to \textquotedbl{}yes\textquotedbl{}
and the build system tries to find a usable generic MPI installation
at the specified location very early during the configuration. If
this step is successful, the compilers and the runner provided by
MPI are used in \textit{lieu} of the user-specified ones, and no further
test is performed. If \textquotedbl{}-{-}with-mpi-prefix\textquotedbl{}
is not present, the build of parallel code will be deactivated unless
\textquotedbl{}-{-}enable-mpi\textquotedbl{} is explicitely set
to \textquotedbl{}yes\textquotedbl{}. \\


If the first attempt fails, a second one is undertaken once the compilers
have been configured. The build system then checks whether the compilers
are able to build MPI source code natively, taking advantage of the
user-specified parameters. If successful, a MPI runner will be looked
for using the \textit{PATH} environment variable. If something goes
wrong, the build of parallel code will be automatically disabled.
In such a case, and as a last resort, the user may force the build
through the use of \textquotedbl{}-{-}enable-mpi=manual\textquotedbl{}.
\\


Additional levels of parallelization may be activated, though they
are still experimental and meant to be used by developers only: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textquotedbl{}-{-}enable-mpi-io\textquotedbl{}: parallel file I/O; 
\item \textquotedbl{}-{-}enable-mpi-trace\textquotedbl{}: parallel time
tracing. 
\end{itemize}
You will find a detailed description of all these options in the source
package of ABINIT, within the MPI support section of the \textquotedbl{}{~}abinit/doc/build/config-template.ac8\textquotedbl{}
template. We warmly recommend you to have a close look at this file
and to use it as much as you wish.


\section{External libraries}

The \textit{configure} script of ABINIT provides a unified way of
dealing with external libraries, by means of a trigger (enable/disable)
and two specifiers (for include and link flags) for each package.
Below the surface, things are however much more complex: some libraries
are required by ABINIT, others not; some are contained within the
source package, others are too big to be included; a few of them depend
on other external libraries, which may or may not be found within
the package. The current situation is summarized in table \ref{tab:dsc-extlibs},
and the corresponding options are described in table \ref{tab:opt-extlibs}.
\\

\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}

\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Specifications of the ABINIT libraries.}


\label{tab:dsc-extlibs} 
\end{table}


When a library is required and cannot be found outside the source
package, the build system systematically restores consistency by ignoring
user requests and disabling the corresponding support. \\


Providing automatic external library detection lead to complicate
the build system too much, and jeopardized its maintainability. Hence
we decided to aim at maximum simplicity. This means that you need
to provide the include and link flags yourself, just as you would
do when directly calling the compiler, e.g.:

\section{Other options}

The \textit{configure} script provides a few more options. Though
most of them will only be used in specific situations, they might
prove very convenient in these cases. The full list of special options
may be found in table \ref{tab:opt-special}. \\


The build system of ABINIT makes it possible to use config files to
store your preferred build parameters. A fully documented template
is provided in the source code under \textit{~abinit/doc/build/config-template.ac8},
along with a few examples in \textit{~abinit/doc/build/config-examples/}.
After editing this file to suit your needs, you may save it as \textit{\$HOME/.abinit/build/$<$hostname$>$.ac}
to keep these parameters as per-user defaults. Just replace \textit{$<$hostname$>$}
by the name of your machine, excluding the domain name. E.g.: if your
machine is called \textit{myhost.mydomain}, you will save this file
as \textit{\$HOME/.abinit/build/myhost.ac}. You may put this file
at the top level of an ABINIT source tree as well, in which case its
definitions will apply to this particular tree only. Using config
files is highly recommended, since it saves you from typing all the
options on the command-line each time you build a new version of ABINIT.
