<h1>MPI support in the build system</h1>

<div class="warning">
This document is only valid for ABINIT &ge; 5.3.4.
</div>

<p>Providing a unified interface to MPI support is a very delicate task,
as there is currently no real standard neither for implementation nor
for installation.
Up to ABINIT 5.3, the interface to MPI support in the build system
was a little bit confusing, and was permanently undergoing a lot of
changes. It has now been clarified, and will keep stable at least for
the lifetime of ABINIT 5.4.</p>

<p>The "--enable-mpi" option to the "configure" script is controlling all
the others:</p>
<ul>
 <li>"--enable-mpi=yes" is the default and triggers MPI auto-detection;</li>
 <li>"--enable-mpi=no" switches off the build of parallel code;</li>
 <li>"--enable-mpi=manual" bypasses auto-detection and uses user-specified
 build parameters; the parallel code will be built independently of
 the relevance and correctness of these parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p>If "--enable-mpi" is set to "yes", the parallel code will be built only if
a usable MPI implementation can be detected. First the build system will
check whether the Fortran compiler is able to build MPI source code
natively, i.e. without any additional parameters. If not, the
"--with-mpi-prefix" option <em>must</em> be specified, and point to the
top directory of a MPI installation. All other "--with-mpi-*" options will
be ignored. The build system will then try to find executable "mpif90" and
"mpirun" binaries in the MPI "bin/" subdirectory, and perform very basic
checks. If something goes wrong, the build of parallel code will be
automatically disabled.</p>

<p>If "--enable-mpi" is set to "manual", the "--with-mpi-prefix" option will
be ignored, contrary to all the other ones. In this case, specifying correct
build parameters is under the responsibility of the user, since
auto-detection is turned off. In most situations it means feeding the
compiler with suitable include flags through the "--with-mpi-fcflags"
option, as well as relevant link flags through "--with-mpi-fc-ldflags".</p>

<p>When your compiler is natively able of producing MPI-ready code, it
is better to specify its full path in the "FC" environment variable, as
it will greatly help the build system finding the correct associated MPI
runner ("mpirun" or "mpiexec"). Alternatively you may specify it in the
"--with-mpi-run" option of the "configure" script. A warning will be
issued if the runner is not found.</p>

<p>Additional levels of parallelization may be activated, though they
are still experimental and meant to be used by developers only:</p>
<ul>
 <li>"--enable-mpi-fft": parallel FFT;</li>
 <li>"--enable-mpi-io": parallel file I/O;</li>
 <li>"--enable-mpi-trace": parallel time tracing.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will find a detailed description of all these options in the source
package of ABINIT, within the MPI support section of the
"~abinit/doc/build/config-template.ac9" template.</p>
