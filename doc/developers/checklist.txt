1. Introduction

A few days before the developers sent their contributions
for the merge, it is worth that they examine whether they
have not forgotten to do "something". This is the aim of
this checklist.

2. Check list

Have you mentioned your initials (or full name) in the
copyright of the routine you have modified ?

Have you set up one (or a few) test cases, so as to provide
the input and output files as references, to check that
the merge of your routines has been succesful ?
The CPU time of this test should exceed 30secs on a PC at 400MHz,
or 15 secs on a better workstation.

Are you sure that your modifications do not deteriorate
the performance of the code in the regime where your
modifications are not used ? You should inspect your
modifications for both memory use and CPU time.
