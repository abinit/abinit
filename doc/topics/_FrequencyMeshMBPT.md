This page gives hints on how to define frequency meshes (on the imaginary and real axes)
for MBPT calculations with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

In the contour deformation technique, and other cases, one has to define a set
of frequencies on which different numerical operations will be performed
(computation of susceptibility matrices, integration along the real+imaginary
axes). In the present topic, the input variables connected to such definitions
are gathered.

* [[tutorial:gw2|The second tutorial on GW]] deals with the computation of the quasi-particle band structure of Aluminum, in the GW approximation (so, much better than the Kohn-Sham LDA band structure) without using the plasmon-pole model.
