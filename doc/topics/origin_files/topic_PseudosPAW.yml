    introduction: |
      ABINIT can read many different types of norm-conserving pseudopotentials and PAW atomic data. 
      The names of the files to be used in an ABINIT run 
      are to be provided in the [[help:abinit#intro1|"files" file]], one for each [[topic:AtomTypes|type of atom]].
      Note that one cannot mix norm-conserving pseudopotentials with PAW atomic data files in a single ABINIT run,
      even for different datasets. One has to stick either to norm-conserving pseudopotentials or to PAW.

      <p><b>Norm-conserving pseudopotential tables</b>
      <p>There are several sets of norm-conserving pseudopotentials available for
      most elements of the periodic table, either in LDA or in GGA-PBE. 
      The [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/pseudodojo/pseudodojo|recommended one]] (GGA-PBE, [[ixc]]=11) 
      comes from the ONCVPSP generator (with spin-orbit coupling).
      The Goedecker HGH table (LDA, [[ixc]]=1, also including spin-orbit coupling) 
      is also available, at [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/hgh]].
      It is rather accurate, but requires often large [[ecut]].
      The old Troullier-Martins type tables (
      [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/lda_tm|LDA]] [[ixc]]=1 and 
      [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/gga_fhi|GGA]] [[ixc]]=11) are deprecated, because not accurate enough,
      and also not including spin-orbit coupling. The different format for norm-conserving 
      pseudopotentials are described in [[https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=developers:pseudos]].

      <p><b>PAW atomic data tables</b>
      <p>Five large sets of PAW atomic data can be read by ABINIT.
      The recommended one (JTH) for both LDA and GGA-PBE is available on 
      [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW2/index.html|the ABINIT web site PAW page]]. It uses the PAW-XML format.
      The links to other sets are provided in the same Web page, see the end of the section "Documents and tools"

      <p><b>Validation</b>
      <p>Many pseudopotentials (norm-conserving as well as PAW) have been tested against all-electron calculations, 
      see the section "Documents and tools" paragraph about the "Delta" project 
      on [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW2/index.html|the ABINIT web site PAW page]].
      In [[lesson:paw3]] it is explained How to perform more detailed comparisons with an all-electron code.

      <p><b>Generation</b>
      <p>Six codes are available to generate new pseudopotentials when needed, see 
      [[http://www.abinit.org/downloads/atomic-data-files|the related ABINIT web page]].
      For norm-conserving pseudopotentials, ONCVPSP is the preferred one.
      The ultra-soft pseudopotentials generated by "USPP" are approximations of the
      Projector Augmented Wave approach, and are treated within the PAW framework in ABINIT.
      The ATOMPAW generator is actually tightly connected to ABINIT 
      such that there are ABINIT automatic tests in which a PAW atomic data is generated, and then
      used in ABINIT. There is also a dedicated tutorial to ATOMPAW/ABINIT.
      <p><b>Miscellaneous</b>
      <p>Norm-conserving pseudopotentials can be mixed, to generate "alchemical" pseudoatoms, see [[topic_AtomTypes]].
