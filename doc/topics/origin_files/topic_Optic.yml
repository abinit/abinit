    introduction : |- 
      The easiest approach to linear and non-linear optical makes a drastic approximation, the
      independent-particle approximation (IPA): the electrons are supposed
      independent of each others when reacting to the optical perturbation (even if the initial computation of the
      band structure includes interactions in a mean-field sense, like with DFT). 
      This approximation is also referred to as a "Sum-Over-States" approach (SOS).
      <p>
      This neglects all electron-hole interaction (so no excitonic effects), but might provide meaningful results
      in many case, sometimes even quantitatively. A first problem is linked with the erroneous
      band gap of the material, but this might be corrected by a scissor approximation, see e.g. [[scissor@optic]]. To take into account
      the excitonic effects, see [[topic_BSE]].
      <p>
      In the ABINIT package, there are two different utilities to compute optical response 
      in the independent-particle approximation : [[help:optic]] and conducti. They have been developed independently
      of each other, and thus overlap significantly.
      The first one permits to cover the linear and non-linear optical properties as a function of the frequency. 
      It provides the optical dielectric tensor, the second-harmonic generation (SHG) as well as the optical rectification
      tensor (or electro-optic tensor - without the contribution from the nuclei displacements, see [[topic_nonlinear]].
      The second one "conducti" has more restricted capabilities, only at the linear level.
