    introduction : |- 
        <p>In principle, the exact self-energy can be obtained by solving self-consistently the set of coupled integro-differential equations
        proposed by Hedin [[Hedin1965]]. The fundamental building blocks of Hedin's equations are, besides &Sigma;(1,2), 
        the Green's function of the interacting many-body system, G(1,2), the Green's function of an appropriate noninteracting system, G<sub>0</sub>(1,2),
        and the irreducible polarizability, &chi;(1,2), which, through the inverse dielectric matrix &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>(1,2),
        re-normalizes the static Coulomb potential, resulting in the dynamical screened interaction W(1,2). 
        Finally, the vertex function &Gamma;(1,2,3) describes the interactions between virtual holes and electrons.
        <p>A typical self-energy calculation combines a quasi-particle band structure with a screened interaction and possibly 
        a vertex correction to the QP corrections ([[optdriver]]=4). 
        <p>In the frequency domain, the GW self-energy &Sigma;(&omega;) can be evaluated in ABINIT with two different, more effective, techniques: 
        <li>integration with a plasmon-pole model (PPM)</li>
        <li>integration with contour deformation (CD).</li>
        <p>In the former case, the frequency dependence of &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>(&omega;) is modeled with a simple analytic form,
        and the frequency convolution is carried out analytically.
        <p>In the latter approach, the integral is evaluated numerically extending the functions in the complex 
        plane in order have a smoother integrand.

        <p>Four different plasmon pole models (PPMs) are available in ABINIT.
        The choice of the particular PPM to be used is controlled by the variable [[ppmodel]].
        The first two options ([[ppmodel]]=1,2) refer to approximations employed in the pioneering implementations 
        of the GW formalism: the plasmon-pole models of Godby-Needs [[Godby1989]] (GN) 
        and Hybertsen and Louie [[Hybertsen1986]] (HL).
        <p>The contour deformation technique is activated by setting the input variable [[gwcalctyp]] to 2.
        The integration along the imaginary axis requires the calculation of &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>(&omega;) for purely imaginary frequencies.
        The frequency mesh for the quadrature is governed by the input variable [[nfreqim]], and can be very coarse 
        since the integrands is very smooth in this region.
        <p>The evaluation of the residue of the poles requires the calculation of &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>(&omega;) on a fine mesh along the real axis.
        This regular mesh, sampling the interval [0,+&infin;], is defined by the two input variables [[nfreqre]] and [[freqremax]].
        <p>The CD approach requires many evaluations of &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>(&omega;) and can therefore be computationally highly demanding. 
        On the other hand, it is the preferred approach for calculating the QP correction of low-lying states.
        Moreover, it is the only technique available in ABINIT to compute the imaginary part of &Sigma;(&omega;) 
        and the spectral function A(&omega;).

        <p> It is possible to disable the full computation, and actually do an Hartree-Fock, screened exchange, COHSEX or hybrid functional calculation.
        <p> The calculation is done in a precomputed basis set, that can be Kohn-Sham (e.g. PBE) or generalized Kohn-Sham (e.g. HSE06).
        <p> As vertex corrections, the bootstrap kernel and others can be included in the self-consistent W. The Faleev method, see PRL 93, 126406 (2004), is implemented.
        <p> Convergence over the number of unoccupied band is much improved with respect to usual implementations of GW, 
        thanks to the "extrapolar" method.
        <p>The frequency meshes, used e.g. for integration along the real and imaginary axes are described in [[topic_FrequencyMeshMBPT]].
