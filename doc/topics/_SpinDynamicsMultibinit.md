This page gives hints on how to perform a spin dynamics calculation with the Multibinit package.

## Introduction

Multibinit uses the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to perform spin dynamics at finite temperature. A more detailed description can be found in the tutorial page [[tutorial:spin_model]]. 
  
  
## Tutorials
[[tutorial:spin_model]] :  the tutorial for running the spin dynamics with Multibinit can be found.
