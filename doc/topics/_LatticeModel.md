This page gives hints on how to build a lattice model in multibinit.

## Introduction

The MULTIBINIT software is based on a second-principles approach for lattice dynamics simulations using atomic potentials fitted on first-principles calculations [[cite:Wojdel2013]].
See the [[help:multibinit|MULTIBINIT user guide]].
The set up of a lattice model is the first step of the second-principles approach. 
It has a harmonic part and possibly an anharmonic part.
For the harmonic part, see the tutorial below.
For the anharmonic part, see other topics namely, the [[topic:FitProcess |topic for the fit process]] and the [[topic:BoundingProcess |topic for the bound process]].
Then, one can run a dynamics, see the [[topic:DynamicsMultibinit |topic how to run a dynamics]].

## Tutorials

The [[tutorial:lattice_model|First lesson on Multibinit]] explains how to build a lattice model and to run a dynamics.
