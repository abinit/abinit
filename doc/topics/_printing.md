This page gives hints on how to print some useful quantities with the ABINIT package.

## Introduction

Many quantities are computed, but not reported in the main ABINIT output file.  
On demand, they can be printed thanks to the following
prt&langle;suffix&rangle; input variables. Usually, a corresponding file
suffixed with _&langle;suffix&rangle; will be printed. In other cases, the
main output will be modified to contain the data.
