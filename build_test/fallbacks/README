Abinit Fallbacks
================

Overview
--------

Abinit Fallbacks is a package builder for the external dependencies of Abinit,
in development environments lacking these components. They do not provide full
support for the advanced features of Abinit nor HPC-grade calculation
capabilities. They are designed to let developers quickly test new versions of
these external dependencies in various situations before proposing upgrades, as
well as to allow end-users to run calculations on their favorite PCs.
