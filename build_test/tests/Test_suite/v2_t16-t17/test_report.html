              <p><a href='t16.abi'>[v2][t16][np=1]</a><br>Analyze a DDB for Silicon. Lattice parameter = 10.18 Angstrom. Here, IFCs are obtained, and can be<br>compared to those published in Table I of Rignanese et al, PRB53, 4488 (1996). For example, the<br>atoms numbers for NN=0,1,2,5 in Table I are found as atoms 1,5,17,20. The numbers are equal in the<br>paper or in the output of the code. The frequencies at X and L points are also computed. They can be<br>compared with those provided in TABLE II (TA(X) mode at 140.466 cm-1) and TABLE III (TA(L) mode at<br>108.626 cm-1) in the above-mentioned paper. The numbers are equal in the paper or in the output of<br>the code. Thermodynamic quantities are also obtained. The input parameters of the code does not give<br>particularly well converged quantities (one needs reasonable CPU time for testing !), but it is OK<br>for comparison with the paper. In the output of the code, a mole corresponds to the number of<br>Avogadro times one CELL. As a Silicon cell contains 2 atoms, caution must be taken in the comparison<br>with experiment ! We will refer to the numbers given by the code as being given for a mole-cell (in<br>short a mol-c). The distinction between the usual definition of a mole (Avogadro number times 1<br>Silicon atom) and a mole-cell (Avogadro number times 2 Silicon atom) was unfortunately the source of<br>errors in the paper by Rignanese et al (our thanks to Steve Erwin for noticing this - an errata<br>should be written). From the output of the code ( zero Kelvin is approximated by results at 1<br>Kelvin) : the zero point contribution to the Helmholtz free energy is 11.90 kJ/mol-c , so 5.95<br>kJ/mole ; the entropy at 298.15K is 38.25 J/(mol-c.K), so 19.12 J/(mole.K) ; the constant-volume<br>specific heat at 298.15K is 39.59 J/(mol-c.K), so 19.80 J/(mole.K) ; the change in F (Helmholtz free<br>energy) from 1 K to 298.15 K is -4.91 kJ/mol-c, so -2.45 kJ/mole ; the change in E (internal energy)<br>from 1 K to 298.15 K is 6.49 kJ/mol-c, so 3.25 kJ/mole. Supposing that we take the usual definition<br>of a mole (Avogadro number times 1 Silicon atom), then, in the above-mentioned paper, the FIG. 3, 5<br>and 8 should be rescaled, as well as the zero-point contribution to the Helmholtz free energy (5.95<br>kJ/mole, and not 12 J/mole - the 'k' was also missing), that is only 1.25% of the cohesive energy.<br>The output of the code is now more clear than in 1995, and this kind of error should not appear<br>anymore.
