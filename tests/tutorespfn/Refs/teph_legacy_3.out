 Files file format: 

  Name of the output file
  Integer flag: 0 --> binary output,   1 --> ascii formatted output
  Name of the groud state wavefunction file WF
  Number of 1WF, of GKK files, and number of 1WF files in all the GKK files
  Names of the 1WF files...
  Names of the GKK files...

 Enter name of output file:
 Output                     = teph_legacy_3o_GKK.bin
 Ground State file          = teph_legacy_1o_DS6_WFK
 Number of 1WF files        =    0
 Number of GKK files        =    9
 Total Number of 1WF in GKK =    9
