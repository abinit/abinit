 memorf : COMMENT -
  The determination of memory needs at this stage is meaningless,
  since getcell =  -1 is non-zero, while idtset= 12.
  The following numbers are obtained by supposing that acell and rprim
  are NOT taken from a previous dataset. You cannot rely on them.

P This job should need less than                      63.154 Mbytes of memory.
  Rough estimation (10% accuracy) of disk space for files :
_ WF disk file :     17.702 Mbytes ; DEN or POT disk file :      0.033 Mbytes.

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   10.935850 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   10.935850 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   10.978210 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   10.984180 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   10.984180 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   10.935850 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 Suggested references for the acknowledgment of ABINIT usage.

 The users of ABINIT have little formal obligations with respect to the ABINIT group
 (those specified in the GNU General Public License, http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt).
 However, it is common practice in the scientific literature,
 to acknowledge the efforts of people that have made the research possible.
 In this spirit, please find below suggested citations of work written by ABINIT developers,
 corresponding to implementations inside of ABINIT that you have used in the present run.
 Note also that it will be of great value to readers of publications presenting these results,
 to read papers enabling them to understand the theoretical formalism and details
 of the ABINIT implementation.
