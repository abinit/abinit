#Common input variables

#Definition of the unit cell

       0.5  0.0  0.5   # (to be scaled by acell) were 1 0 0  0 1 0  0 0 1 
       0.5  0.5  0.0   # that is, the default.

#Definition of the atom types
ntypat 2               # There are two types of atom
znucl 13 33            # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the 
                       # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s) 
                       # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                       # to the type(s) of atom. Here, type 1 is the Aluminum,
                       # type 2 is the Arsenic.

nband  4               # For an insulator (if described correctly as an insulator 
                       # by DFT), there is no need to include conduction bands

#Exchange-correlation functional

#Definition of the planewave basis set

#Definition of the k-point grid
kptrlatt -4  4  4      # In cartesian coordinates, this grid is simple cubic, and
          4 -4  4      # actually corresponds to the so-called 8x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack grid.

                       # ngkpt, nshiftk and shiftk .

#Definition of the SCF procedure

diemac 9.0             # Although this is not mandatory, it is worth to
