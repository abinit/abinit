# Finite difference calculation of the Born effective charges of AlP

# The calculation proceeds by computing the change in cell polarization
# by a Berrys phase formula, due to moving one of the atoms in the cell

# Berry phase calculation of the polarization
# berryopt -1 triggers the implementation of M. Viethen
berryopt -1

#Definition of the unit cell
# these cell parameters were derived from a relaxation run done with the
# current ecut and kpt values. The current ecut value used is very low but
# is done to speed the calculations.
#
# Note that for a cubic space group as found here, the primitive unit
# cell is often represented as (0,a/2,a/2); (a/2,0,a/2); (a/2,a/2,0). 
# Here abinit uses 1/sqrt(2) as the normalizer and adjusts acell (the cell
# length scale) accordingly. All this is copied from the output of the relaxation
# run.

 nband 4 # nband is restricted here to the number of filled bands only, no empty bands. The theory of
         # the Berrys phase polarization formula assumes filled bands only. Our pseudopotential choice
         # includes 5 valence electrons on P, 3 on Al, for 8 total in the primitive unit cell, hence
         # 4 filled bands.

#atomic positions. Here we do three separate computations, where the Al atom is moved (manually)
#from its equilibrium position at 0,0,0 in calculation 1, to (+/-0.01,0,0) offsets in calculations 
#2 and 3. The P position is again taken from the value in the relaxation calculation done
#previously.
