# Finite electric field calculation of AlP at clamped atomic positions
#
# Here the polarization of the cell is computed as a function of increasing
# external homogeneous electric field.

# berryopt 4 is used to trigger the finite field calculation, while
# the efield variable sets the strength (in atomic units) and direction
# of the field

# we can run many (11) fields, or just 3, to make a quick run.

        21  # 22  23  24  25     # The additional 8 values of the field have been suppressed to save CPU time
        31  # 32  33  34  35

# the initial run is at zero field and uses berryopt -1

# runs with finite field use berryopt 4, efield, and
# must read in the wavefunctions of the previous run with smaller field
# if variables tagged by numbers like 22, 23, 24, 25 are defined but
# not called by jdtset (above), they will be quietly ignored. This
# feature gives a lot of flexibility in an input file.

 nband 4 # nband is restricted here to the number of filled bands only, no empty bands. The theory of
         # the Berrys phase polarization formula assumes filled bands only. Our pseudopotential choice
         # includes 5 valence electrons on P, 3 on Al, for 8 total in the primitive unit cell, hence

#change due to strain the atoms will move as well.
