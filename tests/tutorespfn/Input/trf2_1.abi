# Crystalline AlAs : computation of the phonon spectrum

# initial steps: compute ground state wavefunctions accurately and the DDK
# wavefunctions accurately

  ndtset 2

# first dataset: accurate ground state wavefunctions
  kptopt1  1            # Automatic generation of k points, taking
                        # into account all symmetries
  tolvrs1   1.0d-18     # SCF stopping criterion

# second dataset: DDK wavefunctions, needed later for electric field
  kptopt2 2             # DDK can use only time reveral symmetry
  getwfk2 -1            # require ground state wavefunctions from previous run
  rfelfd2 2             # activate DDK perturbation
  iscf2   -3            # this is a non-self-consistent calculation
  tolwfr2 1.0D-20       # tight convergence on wavefunction residuals
