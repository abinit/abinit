# Finite difference calculation of the clamped-ion
# piezoelectric constants of AlP
#
# The calculation proceeds by computing the change in cell
# polarization by a Berrys phase formula, due to changes 
# in the strain of the unit cell. "Clamped-ion" refers to the
# fact that the ions move with the strains but are not 
# allowed to relax to their new equilibrium positions

# Berry phase calculation of the polarization
# berryopt -1 triggers the implementation of M. Viethen

# three cell geometries will be computed
