PART3-EFIELD 

Finite electric field calculations in order
to get various quantities from field evolution
of forces, polarization, stress

Two steps :

1. alas_clampedion.in
Finite electric field calculation at fixed ionic positions

2. alas_relaxedion.in
Finite electric field calculation at relaxed atomic positions
