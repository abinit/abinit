#%%   Test of self-consistent model GW (2 iterations) following Faleev et al.,
#%%   [PRL 93, 126406 (2004)] followed by construction of quasiparticle
#%%   maximally-localized wannier functions [Hamann & Vanderbilt,
#%%   arXiv:0810.3616v1 (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)].  Cutoffs are set for test-
#%%   acceptable speed, and the results are poorly converged.  The input
#%%   file is sufficiently annotated to serve as a model.  Note that well-
#%%   converged GW calculations are extremely time consuming, and in general
#%%   it is advisable to run the SCGW part separately on a parallel system,
#%%   and then run a separate serial job modeled on the last dataset,
#%%   substituting "irdwfk" and "irdqps" for "getwfk" and "getqps," with
#%%   appropriate links to the files produced in the serial run.  Note that
#%%   the _DEN file from the first dataset is also needed as input, although
#%%   the discontinued "irdden" input variable is not needed or supported.
#%%   Note that acceptable names for the secondary input file needed by the
#%%   wannier90 library are wannier90.win, w90.win, abo_DSn_w90.win (ndtset
#%%   >0) and abo_w90.win (ndtset=0), where abo is the 4th line of the .files
