This directory, paral, contains tests which exercise parallel
features of the ABINIT package, for which mpiio is NOT activated.

Please, see the README file in the tests directory (above this one) to get help.


Tests 01 to 20 are related to ground-state (and TDDFT) parallel computations, based on k-point, spin and image parallelism only (no band-FFT).
Tests 21 to 50 are related to ground-state parallel band-FFT computations, possibly combined with the other levels of parallelisation.
Tests 51 to 70 are related to response-function parallel computations
Tests 71 to 80 are related to GW calculations
Tests 81 to 101 are other types of calculations (DMFT at present, multibinit and BigDFT).
