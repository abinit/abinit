# Molecular SiH4 in GWLS (G0W0 with Lanczos basis and Sternheimer equations)
# There are 3 datasets
# 1: Calculation of the Ground State density
# 2: Calculation of the Ground State wavefunctions
# 3: Calculation of the Self-Energy matrix element <gwls_band_index|\Sigma(gw_freqsp)|gwls_band_index>

### Specific variables

 # Ground state calculation (density)
 toldfe1 1d-10
 paral_kgb1 0              # Parallel ground state calculations don't work for molecules (the minimisation algorithm becomes unstable).
 
 # Ground state calculation (wavefunctions)
 tolwfr2  1d-25
 getden2 1
 iscf2 -2
 paral_kgb2 0
 
 # GWLS calculation for the HOMO
 tolwfr3  1d-25            # This is the precision to which the Sternheimer eqs. are solved in GWLS.
 getden3 1
 getwfk3 2
 optdriver3 66             # This is the optdriver triggering a GWLS calculation.

 gwls_band_index3 4        # This is the band for which the matrix element of the Self-energy is requested : <gwls_band_index|\Sigma(gw_freqsp)|gwls_band_index>
 gw_customnfreqsp3 1       # This is the number if frequencies at which the matrix element of the Self-energy is requested.
 gw_freqsp3 -0.5558150504  # These are the frequencies at which the matrix element of the Self-energy is requested.
 gwls_stern_kmax3 8  # This controls the convergence with respect to the size of the dielectric matrix.
 gwls_kmax_complement3 8   # This controls the convergence with respect to the size of the MODEL dielectric matrix.
 gw_icutcoul3 0              # For molecules, the coulomb potential needs to be spherically truncated.
 rcut3 9.0                 # The spherical truncation has this radius. 

 prtwf3 0                  # By default, WFs would be printed with mpiio. However, the NAG compiler (on petrus) takes forever to do so. Since these WFs are totally unuseful and this is not a mpiio test, printing WFs is disabled. 
 prtden3 0                 # Same reason as WFs.
 gwls_recycle3 1           # The writing to file (gwls_recycle3 2) is more desirable as it saves a lot of RAM on production runs, but petrus + NAG 5.3.1 + OpenMPI 1.6.2 cause a BUG with writing / reading unformatted fortran files. For the time being, we won't test this, then.

### Common variables

# Other parameters
 istwfk  *1                # GWLS doesn't support time reversal symetry.      
 nline 100                 # GWLS linear equation solver may require many steps at problematic frequencies.

# Number of bands
# NOTE : The last band must be higher in energy that the higher gw_customnfreqsp requested by the user.
 nband 10

# Parallelisation : GWLS supports parallelism over bands and FFTs (from the ground state implementation),
# but FFT parallelism tends to have poor efficiency in GWLS.
# The optimum is usually to set the highest possible npband.
