#%% description = 
#%%   Calculation of the electron-phonon band structure renormalisation for Diamond,
#%%   due to the phonon at the Gamma point.
#%%   The computation with ecut=20 Ha and elph2_imagden 0.0 gives 24.482 meV for the
#%%   HOMO shift at Gamma, while the finite-difference of phonon frequencies
#%%   gives 28.975 meV, in excellent agreement with frozen-phonon changes of HOMO eigenenergy.
#%%   The difference is due to the Non-Site-Diagonal Debye-Waller contribution, that
#%%   was explicitly obtained by a finite-difference approach.
