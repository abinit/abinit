#%%  Isolated Hydrogen atom. Treated with the Fermi-Amaldi correction (ixc=20), so that this
#%%  corresponds to exact cancellation of the Hartree and XC contributions,
#%%  as it should for Hydrogen atom.
#%%  Examine the 1s-2s splitting, that should be equal to 0.375 Ha,
#%%  and is obtained at 0.368 Ha (so within 2%), with the chosen ecut and acell.
#%%  This quantity converges much faster to the correct value than either the total 
#%%  energy or the 1s eigenenergy.
#%%  Also test effmass_free. A value 10 times bigger than the usual electron mass
#%%  leads to a 10-fold contraction of the system. The 1s-2s splitting is
#%%  multiplied by 10 exactly, provided ecut, acell and the smearing of the
#%%  potential at origin are scaled appropriately.
