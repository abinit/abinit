#%%   Isolated Helium atom (see below). Treated without any XC energy (ixc=0). 
#%%   The total energy is -1.9442 Ha.
#%%   10.-20. Isolated Helium atom tests.
#%%   These tests exercise different xc functionals, in the spin-unpolarized case.
#%%   The helium atom is isolated in a box of size 5x5x5, with one
#%%   special point (1/4 1/4 1/4), 200 Ha cut-off, used with 
#%%   a potential close to the bare He potential 
#%%   (erfc with 0.001 bohr decay length). Errors due to the smallness
#%%   of the supercell size are on the order of 1 mHa, as well as those
#%%   due to the representation of the Coulomb potential by a erfc function.
#%%   The remaining is due to finiteness of the basis set.
#%%   The estimation of the latter errors is presented in the test_cases
#%%   17 and 18. In all these tests, intxc=0.
