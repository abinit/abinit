#%%   Diamond: G0W0 @ scPBE0-1/3 calculation. Monitor the direct gap at Gamma.
#%%   
#%%   First, with the scGW methodology based on a Kohn-Sham basis, 
#%%   then doing the scPBE0 using the planewave basis, followed by a one-shot G0W0.
#%%   The agreement is reasonable with the parameters used in the automatic test,
#%%   but can be improved with better parameters (esp. nband), see later.
#%%   At the PBE level, the (KS) band gap is 5.231 eV,
#%%   At the scPBE0-1/3 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivers 8.101 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivers 8.122 eV.
#%%   At the G0W0-scPBE0-1/3 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivers 7.638 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivers 7.659 eV.
#%%   The macroscopic dielectric constant (at Gamma) is 9.3698 from PBE,
#%%   4.4126 from scPBE0-1/3(KS) and 4.4105 from scPBE0-1/3(planewaves).
#%%   
#%%   These calculations have also been done with better
#%%   parameters, in order to observe a better agreement between the KS basis set and the
#%%   planewave basis set (ecut 20  ecutsigx 20  nband 30 gw_qprange 30 - note however that ecuteps 2 is low),
#%%   at the expense of CPU time.. 
#%%   In this case, one used the PBE0 functional (ixc_sigma=41 or ixc_sigma=-406,
#%%   of even isc_sigma=42 with hyb_mixing=0.25 - all the cases were checked).
#%%   At the PBE level, the (KS) band gap was 5.661 eV,
#%%   At the scPBE0 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivered 7.882 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivered 7.884 eV.
#%%   At the G0W0-scPBE0 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivered 7.820 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivered 7.827 eV.
#%%   The macroscopic dielectric constant (at Gamma) was 7.845 from PBE, 
#%%   4.483 from scPBE0(KS) and 4.490 from scPBE0(planewaves).
