#%%   Nickel ferromagnetic fcc structure with an ONCVPSP pseudo containing valence density.
#%%   We test several improvements that are available when the NC file contains the PS valence charge.
#%%   More specifically, we test the initialization of the density from atomic quantities (initro.F90),
#%%   the correction to the forces due to the residuals and the extrapolation of the density 
#%%   for structural relaxations (well, xred is fixed by symmetry).
#%%   We also test the treatment of the core charge in G-space in the case of GS calculations 
#%%   By default, abinit handles XCCC in real space, here we use nc_xccc_gspace==1 to treat it 
#%%   in G-space using the same approach as the one used in PAW.
