#%%  Diamond. The wtq variable is introduced to be able to reproduce the q-point 
#%%  weight obtained with ngqpt and qptopt.
#%%  The main reason being that the initialization of large q-point (same for k-point) grid
#%%  is extremely slow. Inputing manually the qpt and wtq in the input file avoid such 
#%%  inefficient initialization.
