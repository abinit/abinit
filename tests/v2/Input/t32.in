#%%   The derivative database generated by case 31 is now analyzed, and serves
#%%   to compute a phonon band structure.
#%%   There is a very small breaking of the symmetry-induced degeneracy
#%%   of modes along the (x x x) direction. This is due to an incomplete 
#%%   convergence. Indeed, if one makes tolwfr more stringent 
#%%   for response calculations (from 1.0d-16 to 1.0d-20), the 
#%%   lowest acoustic modes at (0.1 0.1 0.1), that are 4.042cm-1 and
#%%   4.067cm-1, becomes 4.05398 cm-1 and 4.05400 cm-1 . 
#%%   Of course, this effect cannot be seen for other modes, since only
#%%   the acoustic modes are sensitive to that level of accuracy !
