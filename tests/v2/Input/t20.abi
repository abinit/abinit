#%%   Analyze a DDB for BaTiO3, same as test18, but IFCs are
#%%   obtained from a 2x2x2 BCC grid (referred to as M2
#%%   in the above-mentioned paper by Ghosez et al).
#%%   At q(1/8 1/8 1/8), the lowest mode is  i 153.5 cm-1 .
#%%   The error, compared with the reference result of test 18,
#%%   is still 10%, but much less than with the grid of test 19.
#%%   Also, the IFCs are obtained and can be compared with those
#%%   provided in TABLE III-V of the Ghosez et al paper.
#%%   Note the decomposition between dipole-dipole contribution
#%%   and short-ranged contribution.
