#%%   Analyze a DDB for ZrO2, containing only the dynamical
#%%   matrices at Gamma, X and L.
#%%   Generate the IFC using a rough sampling, based on Gamma and X
#%%   only, then produces the phonon band structure along Gamma-X,
#%%   as well as in L.
#%%   The degeneracies can be compared with those of 
#%%   Detraux et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3297 (1998).
#%%   The errors produced with this sampling are still large, as can be
#%%   judged from the comparison at L. The frequencies (in cm-1) from the DDB are
#%%   128.8 (2-deg), 271.4, 413.7 (2-deg), 518.2, 521.8 (2-deg), 598.1 ;
#%%   while from the IFCs, using the interpolation, they are
#%%   152.5 (2-deg), 290.8, 429.6 (2-deg), 434.6 (2-deg), 551.9, 576.0 .
#%%   The same DDB allows to generate a slightly better sampling, by using
#%%   nqshft=2 and two shifts (0.0 0.0 0.0) and (0.5 0.5 0.5).
#%%   In this case, the L point is used for the interpolation. The comparison
#%%   can be done at the level of the mid-point between Gamma and X :
#%%   from the GX grid, one gets
#%%   107.0 (2-deg), 260.3, 295.5 (2-deg), 394.3, 577.0 (2-deg), 682.1  ;
#%%   from the GXL grid, one gets
#%%   106.3 (2-deg), 262.6, 302.7 (2-deg), 403.8, 582.5 (2-deg), 684.2  ;
#%%   while directly from the ABINIT code, one gets
#%%   106.3 (2-deg), 270.0, 277.9 (2-deg), 443.2, 581.6 (2-deg), 681.6  .
#%%   This is not yet satisfactory.
#%%   More points are needed for better results, the next interesting grid
#%%   being obtained by changing ngqpt from 2 2 2 to 4 4 4 in the t22.in file.
#%%   Two additional dynamical matrices are then needed.
