#%%   H2 molecule in a big box.
#%%   Comparison of the modified Broyden algorithm (ionmov=3) with the
#%%   original one (ionmov=2). Start with different values 
#%%   of xcart, from 0.6 to 1.1, by step of 0.1 . The number of Broyden
#%%   steps needed to reach acceptable residual forces
#%%   with the ionmov=3 algorithm are : 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, while
#%%   with the ionmov=2 algorithms, one get : 4, 3, 2, 5, and then,
#%%   either the algorithm does not converge within 8 steps, or it
#%%   converges to a saddle point of the energy !
#%%   This test was hard to make portable. This is why the tolerance
#%%   for fldiff is very large.
