#%%   Analyze a DDB for Silicon. Lattice parameter = 10.18 Angstrom.
#%%   IFCs are computed as in test 16, but by limiting artificially
#%%   the number of allowed interacting shells to 2. The total number
#%%   of atoms to be taken into account is 17 (1 for the shell 0,
#%%   4 for the shell 1, and 12 for the shell 2).
#%%   The frequencies at X and L points are again computed. They
#%%   can be compared with those provided in TABLE II (TA(X) mode
#%%   at 161.684 cm-1) and TABLE III (TA(L) mode at 127.508 cm-1)
#%%   in the above-mentioned paper. The number are close, with
#%%   small differences at the level of 0.001 cm-1 .
