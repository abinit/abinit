#%%   Analyze the DDB of test23. Uses asr=0. 
#%%   If asr is set to 1, the results of test 18 are recovered.
#%%   The effect of asr choice is important in the case
#%%   of BaTiO3, with the pseudopotentials that were used,
#%%   see Ph. Ghosez's thesis.
#%%   The option asr is shown to work on both Gamma and X points :
#%%   the correction is obtained at Gamma, and transferred to X.
#%%   Note that a DDB MUST include the Gamma point.
