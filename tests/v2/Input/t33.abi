# Hydrogen diatomic molecule : computation of derivatives
# of the energy, to a very high accuracy
# Datasets 1 to 5 : GS computations at slightly different geometries,
#  for finite-difference analysis of forces, including the target
#  geometry (for dataset 3)
# Step 6 : RF calculation
# Note : this also tests the use of istwfk==1 in RF with
#  istwfk/=1 in the GS case.

#%%   H2 molecule in a big box : compute VERY accurately
#%%   the derivatives of the energy, by both symmetric finite-differences and
#%%   direct computation of forces and 2DTE.
#%%   Also test the interplay between istwfk/=1 in the GS calculation
#%%   and istwfk==1 in the RF calculation (istwfk/=1 is not yet-991020-
#%%   allowed for RF, which is a shame)
#%%   1) Computation of the first-order derivative of the total energy
#%%   With delta(xred)=0.0002, one gets delta(etot)/delta(xred)=-3.145846551
#%%   With delta(xred)=0.0001, one gets delta(etot)/delta(xred)=-3.145836932
#%%   The combination of both results, in a higher-order finite difference
#%%   formula gives -3.145833726 . The direct computation of forces
#%%   at the target geometry gives -3.145833725869 . The agreement is perfect,
#%%   taking into account the "limited" number of digits (10) of the 
#%%   finite-difference result.
#%%   2) Computation of the second-order derivative of the total energy
#%%   With delta(xred)=0.0002, one gets delta(dedt)/delta(xred)=188.73875
#%%   With delta(xred)=0.0001, one gets delta(dedt)/delta(xred)=188.73837
#%%   The combination of both results, in a higher-order finite difference
#%%   formula gives 188.73824613 . The direct computation of 2DTE
#%%   at the target geometry gives 188.73824613046 . The agreement at the
#%%   level of 11 digits is also perfect.
