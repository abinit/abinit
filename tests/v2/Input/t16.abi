#%%   Analyze a DDB for Silicon. Lattice parameter = 10.18 Angstrom.
#%%   Here, IFCs are obtained, and can be compared to those
#%%   published in Table I of Rignanese et al, PRB53, 4488 (1996).
#%%   For example, the atoms numbers for NN=0,1,2,5 in Table I
#%%   are found as atoms 1,5,17,20. The numbers are equal in the 
#%%   paper or in the output of the code.
#%%   The frequencies at X and L points are also computed. They
#%%   can be compared with those provided in TABLE II (TA(X) mode
#%%   at 140.466 cm-1) and TABLE III (TA(L) mode at 108.626 cm-1)
#%%   in the above-mentioned paper. The numbers are equal in the
#%%   paper or in the output of the code. 
#%%   Thermodynamic quantities are also obtained. The input
#%%   parameters of the code does not give particularly well
#%%   converged quantities (one needs reasonable CPU time for testing !),
#%%   but it is OK for comparison with the paper.
#%%   In the output of the code, a mole corresponds
#%%   to the number of Avogadro times one CELL. As a Silicon cell contains
#%%   2 atoms, caution must be taken in the comparison with experiment !
#%%   We will refer to the numbers given by the code as being given
#%%   for a mole-cell (in short a mol-c). The distinction between
#%%   the usual definition of a mole (Avogadro number times 1
#%%   Silicon atom) and a mole-cell (Avogadro number times 2 Silicon atom) 
#%%   was unfortunately the source of errors in the paper by 
#%%   Rignanese et al (our thanks to Steve Erwin for noticing 
#%%   this - an errata should be written). From the output of the code 
#%%   ( zero Kelvin is approximated by results at 1 Kelvin) : 
#%%   the zero point contribution to the Helmholtz free energy
#%%   is 11.90 kJ/mol-c , so 5.95 kJ/mole ; the entropy at 298.15K
#%%   is 38.25 J/(mol-c.K), so 19.12 J/(mole.K) ; the constant-volume
#%%   specific heat at 298.15K is 39.59 J/(mol-c.K), so 19.80 J/(mole.K) ;
#%%   the change in F (Helmholtz free energy) from 1 K to 298.15 K is
#%%   -4.91 kJ/mol-c, so -2.45 kJ/mole ; the change in E (internal energy) 
#%%   from 1 K to 298.15 K is 6.49 kJ/mol-c, so 3.25 kJ/mole. Supposing 
#%%   that we take the usual definition of a mole (Avogadro number times 1 
#%%   Silicon atom), then, in the above-mentioned paper, the FIG. 3, 5 and 8
#%%   should be rescaled, as well as the zero-point contribution to the
#%%   Helmholtz free energy (5.95 kJ/mole, and not 12 J/mole - the 'k' was 
#%%   also missing), that is only 1.25% of the cohesive energy.
#%%   The output of the code is now more clear than in 1995, and this
#%%   kind of error should not appear anymore.
