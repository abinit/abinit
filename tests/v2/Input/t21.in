#%%   Analyze a DDB for BaTiO3, same as test18.
#%%   Compute the phonon frequencies at Gamma, and also output
#%%   the corresponing eigenvectors. These data can be compared
#%%   with those published by Ghosez et al, Ferroelectrics 194, 39 (1997),
#%%   TABLE II, although the normalisation factor is different.
#%%   For example, the z displacement of mode 1 given by the code
#%%   is ( .25d-4 , .158d-2 , -.261d-2, -.118d-2 , -.118d-2 ), that
#%%   multiplied by -60.54 and rounded to the third digit, 
#%%   gives values that appear in the first line of that TABLE II :
#%%   ( -0.002 , -0.096 , 0.158 , 0.071 , 0.071 )
