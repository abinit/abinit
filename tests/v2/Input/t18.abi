#%%   Analyze a DDB for BaTiO3 (see also tests 19 and 20). Here, 
#%%   no use of IFCs is done. Phonon frequencies at the
#%%   Gamma, X, M, R and along the Gamma-R line are obtained
#%%   directly from the DDB. They are to be compared
#%%   with the data in the TABLE II of Ghosez et al, Ferroelectrics,
#%%   206-207, 205 (1998), as well as FIGURE I. 
#%%   At q(1/8 1/8 1/8), the lowest frequency is  i 136.7 cm-1 .
