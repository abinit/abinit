# Information about the pseudopotentials in this directory

These pseudodojo NC-SR v0.4 large core pseudopotentials have the same characteristics:

* Same pseudopotential generator (ONCVPSP-3.3.0)

* Same pseudopotential format (pspcod 8)

* Same exchange-correlation functional (pspxc -1012 , PW - Perdew-Wang LDA)

* Standard accuracy

They have been downloaded on September 26, 2020 from the Github directory 
in https://github.com/abinit/pseudo_dojo/tree/master/pseudo_dojo/pseudos .
They were NOT available on the pseudodojo Web site, because of lower accuracy than the standard small core 
pseudopotentials delivered on the pseudodojo Web page.
