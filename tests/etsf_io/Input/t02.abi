#%%   Simple Li-F structure with KSS output. This is a two data set run,
#%%   the first dataset being a ground state calculation and the second put
#%%   nbandkss to non-null value to compute the Kohn-Sham structure. The KSS file
#%%   is generated by ETSF-IO. The density of the first dataset also use ETSF-IO
#%%   and dataset two is a good test for density restart.
