# test of constrained (i.e. projected) forces - two molecules in a box, with the
# sum of their relative separations constrained to 8.0
# Test prepared by Steve Erwin

# Atomic structure
#-----------------

# "molecule A" is atom5+atom6, with separation initially 4.0
# "molecule B" is atom7+atom8, with separation initially 4.0
