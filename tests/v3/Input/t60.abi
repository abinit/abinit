#Definition of the atom types
ntypat 2           # There is only one type of atom
znucl 11 17      # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Silicon.


#Definition of the atoms
