# Oxygen molecule, treated with varying occupation numbers,
# with LDA.
#    This is to demonstrate a subtlety of the analysis of
#    finite differences : for metallic occupation numbers,
#    RF computation of 2DTE at Gamma, when taking
#    Fermi energy changes (frzfermi=0), will give the same
#    answer than finite-difference of GS computations.
#    However, in order to find a coherent phonon
#    band structure, and perform the Fourier interpolation,
#    it is likely that the Fermi energy must be frozen
#    (debate was running between Dhamann and XG as of 20040821)

#%%   Metallic occupation numbers.
#%%   For metallic occupation numbers,
#%%   RF computation of 2DTE at Gamma, when taking
#%%   Fermi energy changes (frzfermi=0), will give the same
#%%   answer than finite-difference of GS computations.
#%%   However, prior to v4.4, the change of Fermi energy
#%%   due to the perturbation was not computed.
#%%   This corresponds to calculations performed with frzfermi=1
#%%   (should be used only for testing purposes).
#%%   In dataset 1-3, one computes the total energy and forces,
#%%   without symmetries, as it should be
#%%   for accurate finite-difference tests.
#%%   The reduced gradients with respect to displacements
#%%   of the first atom along z in datasets 1 and 3 are
#%%   -5.705344113253 Ha and -5.692553418498 Ha, giving
#%%   the 2DTE of 127.90 Ha.
#%%   In dataset 4, RF is computed with the Fermi energy correction, 
#%%   and the agreement with finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 
#%%   is good : one gets 127.9068 Ha .
#%%   In dataset 5, RF is computed with frozen Fermi energy
#%%   and the disagreement with
#%%   finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is large:
#%%   one gets 100.9991668 Ha .
