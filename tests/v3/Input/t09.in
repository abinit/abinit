#%%     FCC Yb (1 atom per unit cell),
#%%     using a l=3 psp with s local part.
#%%     Crazy cut-off and number of k points.
#%%     Shows that the derivative of the eigenenergies
#%%     with respect to the wavevector can be obtained
#%%     both by finite differences and analytical means
#%%     (from a preliminary computation in the
#%%     treatment of the ddk perturbation).
#%%     For the (0.25,0.25,0.25) k point,
#%%     the tenth band eigenvalue is -3.01209 eV.
#%%     Going to the (0.251,0.251,0.251) k point
#%%     it becomes -3.00562 eV, with finite-difference
#%%     estimation of the derivative with respect
#%%     to ONE wavevector change (all three
#%%     components changed) being 0.00647 eV/0.001/3=2.157 eV
#%%     This value is unchanged when using the
#%%     data at the (0.253,0.253,0.253) k point.
#%%     The analytical value is 2.15566 eV.
