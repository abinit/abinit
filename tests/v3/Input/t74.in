#%%   This is to demonstrate a subtlety of the analysis of
#%%   finite differences : the effect of the symmetrization.
#%%   In dataset 1-3, one computes the total energy and forces,
#%%   with automatic computation of symmetries, including
#%%   symmetrization of the forces (or reduced gradients).
#%%   The reduced gradients with respect to displacements
#%%   of the first atom along z in datasets 1 and 3 are
#%%   -5.705435136802 Ha and -5.692472863816 Ha, giving
#%%   the 2DTE of 129.62 Ha. 
#%%   In dataset 4, the RF 2DTE is computed, and the agreement with
#%%   finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is quite bad: 
#%%   127.90998027 Ha, 1.5% error !
#%%   However, the agreement with the finite differences
#%%   of forces in datasets 5 and 6 (-5.705349696912 Ha
#%%   and -5.692558689744 Ha), where the symmetrization
#%%   of forces is not done, is excellent : the finite-difference
#%%   gives 127.91007168 Ha, less than 0.0001 Ha error.
#%%   Explanation : forces in the geometry of datasets 1,3,5 and 6
#%%   are not really symmetric, because of the underlying FFT grid,
#%%   used for the evaluation of the XC functional !
#%%   This can be seen in the fulfillment of the acoustic sum rule.
#%%   With the present low-cutoff, the frequency of the acoustic mode
#%%   is 264i cm-1, a strong breaking of the sum rule. With 20Ha,
#%%   the frequency is 43.18 cm-1, much better. 
#%%   Other values : 25 Ha, 19.03i cm-1, 
#%%   30 Ha, 21.02i cm-1, 
#%%   35 Ha, 20.14i cm-1,
#%%   50 Ha,  3.57  cm-1
#%%   Note the (misleading) plateau between 25 Ha and 35 Ha : 
#%%   the convergence towards 0 cm-1 start again only beyond 35 Ha.
#%%   The influence of the FFT grid depends strongly on the pseudopotential.
