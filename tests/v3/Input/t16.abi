#%%   Si crystal. GGA + non-linear XC core correction.
#%%   Compute the interatomic force constant for the displacement of the second atom along (111).
#%%   RF calculation of the 2DTE gives 7.51663417 Ha
#%%   while finite differences gives: with delta(xred)=0.0001, 7.15663267 Ha.
#%%   The agreement is quite good, and might likely be improved by combining finite differences.
#%%   Also compute the ddk and electric field responses. The number of k points is much too small to 
#%%   obtain physical values, but are quite comparable to the result of test v2 #6
