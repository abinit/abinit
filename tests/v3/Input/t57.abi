#%% description =
#%%   MgO FCC crystal, Bader analysis. Examine the Oxygen atom only. 
#%%   Determine correctly 18 bonding critical points,
#%%   24 ring critical points, and 8 cage critical points.
#%%   (In agreement with Euler's relation : #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2)
#%%   The bonding critical points are quite accurate,
#%%   while for the ring critical points, the criteria
#%%   defined by the input variables lstep and lgrad are not fulfilled
#%%   for all the CP. The coordinates are rather inaccurate.
#%%   In particular, the symmetry between RCP is broken.
#%%   This is seen the most clearly at the level of the
#%%   laplacian eigenvalues. This breaking of symmetry
#%%   naturally originates from the fact that the FFT grid
#%%   is not symmetric (the lattice was chosen primitive FCC), 
#%%   so that the finite elements used for the
#%%   interpolation are also not symmetric.
#%%   This cannot be improved by just tuning the numerical
#%%   parameters. Instead, one should consider the Bader
#%%   analysis in a FCC conventional cell, instead of the
#%%   primitive one.
#%%   Get 2 core electrons, 7.6796 valence electrons.
#%%   The nucleus charge is +8. The Oxygen atom-in-molecule
#%%   has a net charge of -1.6796.
