#%%     using the HGH pseudopotential, within LDA.
#%%     Fixed cell dimensions. Treated as a semi-conductor
#%%     Test the response to atomic displacements,
#%%     with spin-orbit. Should give the same answer
#%%     than test 2, except that the k point grid is now
#%%     defined automatically.
#%%     Dataset 8 : frozen-phonon with spin-orbit
#%%     Dataset 10 : RF with spin-orbit.
#%%     The agreement is as good as without

#%%     Warning : the output file of this test 
#%%     is machine-dependent, although the final
#%%     result is not. This is because the
#%%     degeneracy of the GS wavefunctions with
#%%     different spin orientation has not been broken.
