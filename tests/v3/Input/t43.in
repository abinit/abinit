#Definition of the unit cell
acell 10 10 10    # The keyword "acell" refers to the
                  # lengths of the primitive vectors (in Bohr)

#Definition of the atom types
ntypat 1          # There is only one type of atom
znucl 1           # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Hydrogen.


#Definition of the atoms
