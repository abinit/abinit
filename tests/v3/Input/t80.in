#%%   H2 molecule : examine the rotational freedom.
#%%   The present test produces the following 
#%%   vibrational frequencies (with degeneracies indicated):
#%%   56.89 i cm-1 (2)
#%%   0.41   cm-1 (2)
#%%   1.05   cm-1
#%%   3800    cm-1 
#%%   The large frequency corresponds to the stretching
#%%   mode, and has the right order of magnitude.
#%%   The frequencies close to 1 cm-1 corresponds
#%%   to translation modes, and are small enough
#%%   for usual applications.
#%%   The  56.89 i cm-1 mode corresponds to rotation of 
#%%   the H2 molecule. The magnitude of this
#%%   frequency might seem quite
#%%   large. Here are the results of tests made to understand
#%%   this phenomenon. First, note that  
#%%   ecut 12  acell 3*14
#%%   Increasing the value of ecut to 25 decreases
#%%   the magnitude of the frequency to 36.8 cm-1 .
#%%   However, in order to continue to make it smaller,
#%%   the cell size must be increased , and an oscillatory
#%%   behaviour is observed :
#%%   3*16   45.6 i cm-1
#%%   3*18   22.7   cm-1
#%%   3*20   19.1 i cm-1
#%%   3*22   15.7 i cm-1
#%%   3*24   13.7   cm-1
#%%   Many other tests have been set up. In particular,
#%%   it was observed that the frequency of the oscillatory
#%%   behaviour changes with the ecut, and also that 
#%%   using the Gamma point, instead of the 1/4 1/4 1/4 k point
#%%   (used in this test) degrades the convergence.
#%%   The overall picture is as follows.
#%%   There are different reasons for the translation
#%%   and rotation modes to acquire a non-zero frequency
#%%   when plane waves and supercells are used.
#%%   Still, as concerns translations, only the
#%%   existence of a discretization of the XC grid
#%%   is important. For rotations, supercell effects
#%%   are also present :
#%%   - alignement of dipole or quadrupoles
#%%   - interaction between tails of wavefunctions, accross cells
#%%   Since the convergence in supercell size is oscillatory, we infer
#%%   that the breaking of the rotational invariance is mostly 
#%%   due to interaction between wavefunction tails.
#%%   This will be checked by confining the system in a spherical
#%%   well, in a forthcoming test.
