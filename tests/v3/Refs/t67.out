  What is the name of the 3D function (density, potential or wavef) file ?
  => Your 3D function file is : t65o_DS3_WFK

  Does this file contain formatted 3D ASCII data (=0)  
   or unformatted binary header + 3D data        (=1) ?
   or ETSF binary                                (=2) ?
-  1 => Your file contains unformatted binary header + 3D data
  The information it contains should be sufficient.
