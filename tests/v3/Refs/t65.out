 Suggested references for the acknowledgment of ABINIT usage.

 The users of ABINIT have little formal obligations with respect to the ABINIT group
 (those specified in the GNU General Public License, http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt).
 However, it is common practice in the scientific literature,
 to acknowledge the efforts of people that have made the research possible.
 In this spirit, please find below suggested citations of work written by ABINIT developers,
 corresponding to implementations inside of ABINIT that you have used in the present run.
 Note also that it will be of great value to readers of publications presenting these results,
 to read papers enabling them to understand the theoretical formalism and details
 of the ABINIT implementation.
