 Your choice is  0

  Exit inner loop
  Task            0  has been done !

  Run interpolation again? (1=default=yes,0=no)

 For which k-points? (1 to    3)
  => Your k-point is :            3


 For which band ? (1 to    10)
  => Your band number is :            1

  => Your spin polarisation number is :            1

 Do you want to analyze a GW wavefunction? (1=yes,0=no)
 => Your choice is :           0

 Do you want the atomic analysis for this state : 
 (kpt,band)= (    3    1)? 
 If yes, enter the radius of the atomic spheres, in bohr 
 If no, enter 0 
 You entered ratsph=      7.00000000 Bohr
