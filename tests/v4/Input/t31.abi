#%%   Simple cubic lattice of Mg atoms, Bader analysis.
#%%   Determine correctly 6 bonding critical points,
#%%   12 ring critical points, and 8 cage critical points.
#%%   (In agreement with Euler's relation : #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2)
#%%   The positions are very accurate (and fully coherent with symmetries).
#%%   The eigenvalues of laplacian also fulfill the requirements
#%%   symmetry.
#%%   Bader charge is 12.0357, while it should be
#%%   exactly 12 (10 core electrons and 2 valence electrons).
#%%   The error is mostly due to
#%%   insufficient angular sampling (only 5 theta and 5 phi
#%%   in an octant). Going to (10,10) gives 11.9928,
#%%   and (20,20) gives 11.9980. But in the latter case,
#%%   the CPU time required is multiplied by about
#%%   10 when compared to the present setting.
