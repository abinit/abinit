#%% description = 
#%%   Test of the the effect of the first-order Fermi energy on a Q=0
#%%   phonon calculation in metals. 
#%%   The example is for a hypothetical intermetallic compound MgAl2,
#%%   in a structure which can be thought of as fcc Al with every third
#%%   (111) layer replaced by Mg.  Technically, this is the hexagonal
#%%   CdI2 structure, space group #164, P-3 m 1.  For this case, neglect
#%%   of this contribution yields approximately a 2% error in the largest
#%%   interatomic force constants.  Its effect on many force constants
#%%   for this system cancels because of symmetry.  This calculation
#%%   is not particularly well converged, especially with respect
#%%   to k sample.  A well-converged version is in excellent agreement
#%%   with interatomic force constants calculated by numerical
#%%   differentiation of ground-state forces.
