#%%   MgO molecule, Bader analysis.
#%%   Examine the Magnesium atom only.
#%%   This is a pathological case for the currently
#%%   implemented algorithm : the Bader volume is not convex !
#%%   Determine correctly 6 bonding critical points,
#%%   but only finds 4 ring critical points, and not even
#%%   one cage critical point !
#%%   (Euler's relation #BCP-#RCP+#CCP=2 is fulfilled, but
#%%   the number of RCP or CCP is not right)
#%%   Despite that fact that the critical points are not
#%%   all found, one can proceed with the other steps of the
#%%   Bader approach : the CP are only used to get an estimation
#%%   of the minimal and maximal radii of the Bader surface !
#%%   Get 9.8533 core electrons, 1.3388 valence electrons,
#%%   for a total of 11.1922 electrons.
#%%   The nucleus charge is +12. The Magnesium atom-in-molecule
#%%   has a net charge of -0.8078 .
#%%   Comparing with case 33, one sees that the charge neutrality
#%%   is violated at the level of 0.0035 electron charge.
#%%   This is quite good, but a bit lucky. For a better
#%%   charge neutrality, one has to integrate better on the
#%%   angles phi and theta (increase nphi and ntheta), and also to
#%%   increase the ecut of the preliminary abinit run.
#%%   In any case, with the pathology of the Mg Bader volume (being
#%%   not convex), one will miss some charge. It should
#%%   be pretty small, and might even be neglected for all practical
#%%   purposes (the Bader analysis is just a trend analysis, anyhow)
#%%   Nevertheless, in this particular
#%%   case of the MgO molecule, there is a fundamental limit of this
#%%   algorithm...
