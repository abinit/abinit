#%% description = 
#%%   Test of the strain perturbation for the rigid-ion piezoelectric
#%%   tensor.  Rhombohedrally distorted
#%%   AlP as in the previous test, but using a ground-state finite-
#%%   difference calculation of the d/dk wave functions.  Such
#%%   calculations were used extensively to test the response function
#%%   piezoelectric tensor by comparison to numerical derivatives of
#%%   the ground-state polarization.  Using the same k sample in the
#%%   ground state and response function calculations, excellent
#%%   agreement has been obtained in a variety of cases (including a
#%%   better-converged version of this one).  Results using the finite-
#%%   diffrence d/dk and the analytic d/dk as in the preceeding test
#%%   agree in the limit of large k sample. The analytic form converges
#%%   much more rapidly, and is consistent with the slowly converging
#%%   polarization numerical derivatives. The present version of this
#%%   calculation uses berryopt = -2 to utilize the routine
#%%   berryphase_new.f
#%%   The ground-state polarization calculations used to compute the
#%%   numerical derivatives in such tests should also be computed using
#%%   berryphase_new.f setting berryopt = -1 and rfdir = 1 1 1 so that the
#%%   cartesian polarization is automatically generated. This eliminates
#%%   several issues that needed special attention using berryopt = 1
#%%   and the original berryphase.f routine.
#%%   The resulting cartesian polarization derivatives represent the
#%%   "improper" piezoelectric tensor, and have to be corrected to yield
#%%   the "proper" tensor as described in D. Vanderbilt, J. Phys. Chem.
#%%   Solids 61, 147 (2000), using Eq.(15).  The response-function calculation
#%%   gives the proper piezoelectric tensor.  Only the electron response, and
#%%   not the strain-induced movement of the rigid ions contributes to the
#%%   proper tensor.
