#%%   Test of the strain perturbation.
#%%   LaAs in a randomly distorted version of its normal rocksalt structure
#%%   using a non-standard norm conserving potential produced by DRH
#%%   for this test.  Distorted structures were used for most development
#%%   work so that no components of the strain 2nd derivatives would be
#%%   zero by symmetry.  A La compound was chosen because its f nonlocal
#%%   potential makes a significant contribution to the result (10%
#%%   for a well-converged result although only 1% for the low value
#%%   of ecut used here), so it tests that the very complex routines
#%%   for the strain derivatives of the nonlocal energy are behaving
#%%   properly.  (Choices in constructing this La potential were
#%%   restricted by current limitations of the treatment of fhi-
#%%   format potentials, and it should not be used for physics results.)
