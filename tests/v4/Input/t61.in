#%% description = 
#%%   Test of the strain perturbation.
#%%   Si in the usual diamond structrure using a Troullier-Martins
#%%   potential including a model core charge.  The datasets
#%%   include an initial ground state run, 2 pairs of 5 ground
#%%   state runs with incrementally strained lattice vectors rprim
#%%   (xx and yz strains -0.00004, -0.00002, 0, 0.00002, 0.00004),
#%%   and one response function run for the strain 2nd derivatives.
#%%   This set is illustrative of the kind of testing used extensively
#%%   in developing the strain perturbation portions of the code.
#%%   The numerical 2nd derivatives of the energy wrt strains were
#%%   computed by applying a 5-point derivative formula to ucvol*sigma(i,j),
#%%   where the sigmas are the stresses calculated in the series
#%%   of ground state calculations.  These agree with the analytic
#%%   2nd derivatives calculated in the response function run to ~1.E-7
#%%   for the data given here.  The cartesian internal strain (mixed
#%%   second derivative wrt strain and atomic coordinate) agrees to ~1E-8.
#%%   Note that such numerical tests of the internal strain are only valid
#%%   if the forces are zero (relaxed or by symmetry).  Otherwise, the
#%%   reduced-coordinate 2nd derivatives must be used for such tests
#%%   because the conversion to cartesian coordinates is itself strain-
#%%   dependent and will introduce changes in the computed derivatives.
#%%   In the actual development tests, stricter converence criteria were
#%%   used (tolvrs=1.E-24) as well as larger cutoffs, and agreement was
#%%   obtained at the 1.E-9 level.  The model core charge contributes the
#%%   largest component of the error.
#%%   ADDITIONAL NOTE :
#%%   It should be noted that numerical derivative tests of the internal
#%%   strain should be done by comparing the "2nd-order matrix" with numerical
#%%   strain derivatives of the gradients wrt reduced atomic coordinates.
#%%   These are not normally part of the GS output, but can be obtained by
#%%   uncommenting the DEBUG section at the end of prtxf.F90.
#%%   Comparisons between numerical strain derivatives of the cartesian
#%%   forces and the cartesian internal strain tensor will be incorrect
#%%   unless the coordinates have been relaxed and the forces are zero
#%%   within a tight tolerance.
