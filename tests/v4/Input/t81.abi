#%% description = 
#%%   Highly Strained Si (diamond) structure.
#%%   Self-consistent and response function calculations with respect to
#%%   strains and displacements in 3 direction are computed. The structure
#%%   is obtained from relaxing atoms only, after 5% strains eta_3 and eta_6
#%%   were applied on purpose. In this run, two DDB files are generated,
#%%   which are first order and second order derivative data base respectively.
