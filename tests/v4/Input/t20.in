#%%   Test of the pspcod=8 input format (contributed by D.R. Hamann)
#%%   This format is primarily intended to offer a flexible platform
#%%   for those who wish to experiment with their own features in
#%%   norm-conserving pseudopotentials.  A full description and discussion
#%%   is given on the ABINIT wiki 
#%%   https://wiki.abinit.org/doku.php?id=developers:pseudos:psp8_format
#%%   This test case, CaO, is an
#%%   example of self-interaction-corrected pseudopotentials in the
#%%   style of D. Vogel, P. Krueger, and J. Pollmann, Phys. Rev. B 52,
#%%   14 316 (1995).  The bandgap (direct) in the test example, 11.2eV,
#%%   is in excellent agreement with experiment, but is rather strongly
#%%   dependent on the radius at which the self-interaction-correction
#%%   of Ca is (smoothly) cut off.  The sic pseudopotentials used in
#%%   this test should not be considered anything but early-stage
#%%   experiments and should not be used for any other purpose.
