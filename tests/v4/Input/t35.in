#%%   One He atom in a big simple cubic box
#%%   Compute the DOS using the tetrahedron method.
#%%   Also compute the partial DOS.
#%%   There is a quite surprising feature of this very simple DOS,
#%%   that might seem to be due to a bug, but is NOT one.
#%%   Indeed, the obtained DOS is not continuous (vizualize the result
#%%   of DATASET 2):  at two energies, there is a small, but sizeable
#%%   jump. This feature is associated with a rather sparse sampling
#%%   of the Brillouin zone. Indeed, some of the tetrahedra have
#%%   three corners with perfectly identical energies. Such
#%%   a set of corners belong to two different tetrahedra.
#%%   If there is not an equal slope of energy when moving away from
#%%   each sides of the triangles, in the different tetrahedra,
#%%   the DOS is discontinuous at the energy of the three shared corners.
