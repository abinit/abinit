#%% description = 
#%%   Test of the strain perturbation for metals.
#%%   Al in the standard fcc structure using the gth potential.
#%%   An issue with metals is that the fermi energy has a non-zero
#%%   derivative wrt at least some of the strain perturbations.
#%%   Modifications of the "active space" content restored to the
#%%   first-order wavefunction (in vtowfk3.f) were implemented to
#%%   reflect the resulting strain contributions.  The fermi energy
#%%   derivative (itself a 1st-order quantity) depends on the self-
#%%   consistent first-order potential, and thus plays a role in the
#%%   response-function self-consistency loop. As of 4.4.x, a new
#%%   treatment of the first-order fermi energy significantly improves
#%%   the rate of convergence and allows all self-consistency algorithms.
#%%   The results here are in very good agreement with numerical derivatives
#%%   of ground state calculations with the same input parameters.  However,
#%%   the kpt sample is far from converged and completely inadequate for
#%%   real calculations.
