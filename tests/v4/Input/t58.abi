#%%   Test of the strain perturbation with the GGA
#%%   Note that this test and the following one, 59,
#%%   address more advanced features of strain perturbation than the ones
#%%   going with number 60 to 79, and were developed later, but were
#%%   placed here for convenience).
#%%   AlAs in the zincblende structure, with a choice of
#%%   pseudopotenials that include model core charges.  In the LDA, the
#%%   strain perturbation simply introduces perturbing charge densities
#%%   leading to perturbing first-order potentials in a straightforward
#%%   manner.  (This perturbation does act differently on the valence
#%%   and model core charges.)   The GGA is a non-trivial extension,
#%%   since strain perturbs the gradient operator itself.  This test
#%%   is a symmetrized and stripped-down version of a test case used in
#%%   development which yielded agreement between such RF calculations
#%%   and numerical derivatives of GS stresses and forces to 1.e-8 to
#%%   1.e-9 atomic units for the elastic tensor and intenal strain
#%%   coupling parameters.  Acheiving this agreement does require forcing
#%%   a considerably more dense fft grid than the default which is
#%%   accepted here. (ngfft= 50 50 50 was used.)  While only the PBE GGA
#%%   is tested here, all forms present in Abinit should give comparably
#%%   accurate results.
