#%%   This is the anaddb calculation for the case #69, which uses DDB file
#%%   generated by previous calculation. In this run, several tensors under
#%%   different boundary conditions are computed. They are respectly: relaxed ion
#%%   dielectric tensor, free-stress dielectric tensor; relaxed ion elastic
#%%   (and compliance) tensors under fixed-electric and under fixed-
#%%   displacement field boundary conditions; internal strain tensors (
#%%   force response and displacement response); relaxed ion  piezoelectric
#%%   tensors of several different definations (e, d, g, h tensors).
#%%   Please refer to Infos/Theory/vanderbilt-anaddb-notes.pdf for details.
#%%   In the previous version, only relaxed(clamped) ion dielectric, piezoelectric,
#%%   elastic tensors and internal strain tensors were computed. In this new version,
#%%   piezoelectric (d, g, h tensors), free-stress dielectric tensor, elastic
#%%   tensors at fixed displacement filed and elastic tensor with stress correction
#%%   are the new abilities of anaddb.
