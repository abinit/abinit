#%%   Diamond: G0W0 @ scHSE06 calculation. Monitor the direct gap at Gamma.
#%%   
#%%   First, with the scGW methodology based on a Kohn-Sham basis, 
#%%   then doing the scHSE06 using the planewave basis, followed by a one-shot G0W0.
#%%   The agreement is reasonable with the parameters used in the automatic test,
#%%   but can be improved with better parameters (esp. nband), see later.
#%%   At the PBE level, the (KS) band gap is 5.231 eV,
#%%   At the scHSE06 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivers 6.834 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivers 6.850 eV.
#%%   At the G0W0-scHSE06 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivers 7.314 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivers 7.344 eV.
#%%   The macroscopic dielectric constant (at Gamma) is 9.3698 from PBE,
#%%   5.8309 from scHSE06(KS) and 5.8202 from scHSE06(planewaves).
#%%   
#%%   These calculations have also been done with better
#%%   parameters, in order to observe a better agreement between the KS basis set and the
#%%   planewave basis set (ecut 20  ecutsigx 20  nband 30 gw_qprange 30 - note however that ecuteps 2 is low),
#%%   at the expense of CPU time.. 
#%%   At the PBE level, the (KS) band gap was 5.661 eV,
#%%   At the scHSE06 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivered 7.340 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivered 7.341 eV.
#%%   At the G0W0-scHSE06 level, the Kohn-Sham basis delivered 7.806 eV,
#%%   while the plane wave basis delivered 7.807 eV.
#%%   The macroscopic dielectric constant (at Gamma) was 7.845 from PBE, 
#%%   5.033 from scHSE06(KS) and 5.032 from scHSE06(planewaves).
