#%%   Argon solid, experimental lattice parameter.
#%%   Realistic parameters are used (ecut=20, ngkpt=2x2x2 shifted 4 times, but centered on Gamma).
#%%   Test the mGGA functional from Tran and Blaha (correction to Becke-Johnson).
#%%   The LDA gap is observed at Gamma : 8.071 eV, is in reasonable agreement with the gap from the TB paper PRL 102, 226401 (2009),
#%%   where it is mentioned to be 8.16 eV.
#%%   The mGGa gap is 14.688 eV. The TB paper mentions 13.91 eV. The experimental value is 14.20 eV.
#%%   The reading of the kinetic energy density, to start a non-SCF calculation is not yet implemented,
#%%   as of ABINITv6.12.0 .
#%%   This test was used to examine the speed of the convergence in case of elongated cells, up to 16 atoms.
#%%   The mGGA convergence was found to be similar to the LDA convergence.
#%%   Also, test non-self-consistent mGGA calculation, with reading of the previously produced _DEN and _KDEN files.
