#%%   Crystalline aluminum, conventional cell. Test of downsampling for HSE06, PBE0, HSE03.
#%%   2x2x2 for the k point grid in the FBZ
#%%   1x1x1 for the k point grid for the Fock operator in the FBZ
#%%   The results can be directly compared with those of the test libxc#72, which use
#%%   a primitive cell, instead of the conventional one here.
#%%   The k point sampling (and down sampling) perfectly match. 
#%%   The observed difference is only due to the differing xc correlation real space sampling.
#%%   Of course, the total energy from the present test is to be divided by 4, to find a total energy per atom.
#%%   The results are, in Ha/atom (present test for conventional cell / previous for primitive cell / difference):
#%%   LDA    -2.075 716 / -2.075 718 / 0.000 002
#%%   HSE06  -2.095 513 / -2.095 539 / 0.000 026
#%%   PBE0   -2.081 192 / -2.081 193 / 0.000 001
#%%   HSE03  -2.123 089 / -2.123 117 / 0.000 028
#%%   The real space grid sampling cannot appear at the level of the Fock operator,
#%%   that is completely formulated in reciprocal space. The real space functional 
#%%   from HSE06 and HSE03 is apparently more affected by the real space sampling than
#%%   the one from LDA and PBE0 ...
