#%%    LiH molecule
#%%    test the use of spatial chemical potential. The molecule starts aligned along the x direction,
#%%    while the Li chemical potential pulls the Li nucleus.
#%%    The z coordinate of the molecule is changed from 0 to 5 Bohr.
#%%    There is a linear part to the chemical potential. 
#%%    The energy and force should be the same in datasets 11 to 15 (without chemical potentiel).
#%%    One sees that this is not completely the case.
#%%    The force along z vanishes in these cases, because the translational invariance is imposed by ABINIT.
#%%    In datasets 21 to 23, the energy should increase linearly, and the force along z should be non-zero and constant.
#%%    Small fluctuations are observed.
#%%    Dataset 24 and 25 corresponds to the cubic part of the chemical potential.
#%%    Dataset 26 places the molecule at a symmetric value of z. The total energy should be the same as with dataset 11, 16, or 21.
