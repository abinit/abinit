#%%  DS2 Constrains the collinear magnetization around atom 1 to be +0.08 and around atom 2 to be -0.08
#%%  DS3 Constrains the collinear magnetization around atom 1 to be +0.08 and around atom 2 to be -0.08, and the total charge of both to be 0.69.
#%%  DS4 Constrains the collinear magnetization amplitude around atom 1 to be +0.08 and around atom 2 to be -0.08. Same result as DS2.
#%%  DS5 Constrains the collinear magnetization along axis z - not really useful simple sanity check
