#%%   O2 (spin-polarized, non-linear XC core correction, LDA)
#%%   Fixed occupation numbers. The parameters have been artifically tuned
#%%   with the goal to find a small system that reproduces the typical 1D-configuration coordinate diagram,
#%%   with a first total energy curve that shows a minimum, a second (different occupations) total energy curve
#%%   that shows a slightly higher minimum, at a slightly larger interatomic distance, and then the two total energy curves
#%%   cross at an even slightly larger interatomic distance.
#%%   This system will be used as a test bed for the next tests
