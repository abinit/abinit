#%%  DS2 Constrains the collinear magnetization around atom 1 to be +0.70 and around atom 2 to be -0.70
#%%  DS3 Constrains the collinear magnetization around atom 1 to be +0.70 and around atom 2 to be -0.70, and the total charge of both to be 0.00.
#%%  DS4 Constrains the collinear magnetization amplitude around atom 1 to be +0.70 and around atom 2 to be -0.70. Same result as DS2.
#%%  DS5 and DS6 are not really useful, simply sanity checks for imposition of axis or direction of magnetization for collinear magnetism
