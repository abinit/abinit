#%%   dataset 1 : Broyden for one image
#%%   dataset 2 : Broyden for two images, but only the first one has non-zero weight.
#%%   dataset 3 : Broyden for two images, but only the second one has non-zero weight.
#%%   dataset 4 : Broyden for two images, with weights such that the first image has still lower energy than the second
#%%   dataset 5 : Broyden for two images, with weights such that the second image has now lower energy than the first.
#%%   Geometries that mimimize the linear combination of energy at fixed Lagrange parameters can thus be found.
