#%% description = H2 diatomic molecule, static, to check the constrained DFT implementation with constrained charges 
#%%  Constrain the charge around atom 1 to the value 0.5, then work with both atoms and larger spheres
#%%
#%%  For dataset 2, the derivative wrt the constraint, the derivative of the total energy with respect to atomic displacement 
#%%  and the stress calculations have been checked, as follows.
#%%
#%%  Initially, the total energy is -0.99164352451, the target charge is 0.5, and the gradient wrt the charge is computed -0.58356219787.
#%%  Changing the target charge by +0.001 gives etotal -0.99222576777
#%%  Changing the target charge by -0.001 gives etotal -0.99105864425
#%%  Finite-difference gives -0.5835617, in excellent agreement for that level of methodology.
#%%
#%%  For atom 1, dE/dtau (=-force in reduced coordinate) is computed 8.330114676. 
#%%  Changing the atomic position of the first atom from -1.1 to -1.10015
#%%  gives etotal -0.99172669330, to -1.09985 gives etotal -0.99156009221, delivering 8.330054.
#%%  The result of a similar finite-difference estimation with twice bigger values gives 8.329896.
#%%  Combining both results to eliminate the quadratic error gives 8.330107, with an agreement of 5 digits with dE/dtau.
#%%
#%%  The stress is computed 2.755820639e-4 .
#%%  Multiplying both acell and xcart by 1.001 gives etotal -0.99122698240.
#%%  Multiplying both acell and xcart by 0.999 gives etotal -0.99205366103.
#%%  The derivative of total energy wrt to strain is thus 0.41333932. Dividing by the unit cell volume (1500) gives 2.75559e-4 ,
#%%  in excellent agreement for that level of methodology.
