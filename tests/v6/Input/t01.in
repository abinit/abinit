#%%  Chain of Silicon diatomic molecules (4 Si2 molecules in the cell)
#%%  Freeze oscillatory perturbations with different wavelengths and intensities,
#%%  thanks to the qprtrb and vprtrb input variables.
#%%  This should be linked with the computation of the dielectric constant,
#%%  test v2#05, that uses directly the RF capabilities of ABINIT,
#%%  for one diatomic molecule.
#%%  For dataset 1, one reproduces the results obtained in Tv2#05, multiplied by 4.
#%%  The total energy is consistent up to more than 10 digits :
#%%  -6.6499924738006 Ha for Tv2#05, -26.599969895203 Ha for the present calculation.
#%%  For dataset 2, the perturbation qprtrb 0 0 1 is frozen in, with vprtrb 100.
#%%  The total energy is -26.600317638775 Ha. The difference wrt the unperturbed situation is
#%%  0.000348743572 Ha.
#%%  For dataset 3, a much smaller perturbation (10 times smaller) is taken,
#%%  giving total energy -26.599973367786 Ha. The difference wrt the unperturbed situation is
#%%  0.3472583 microHa.
#%%  For dataset 4, an even smaller perturbation (100 times smaller) is taken,
#%%  giving total energy -26.599969929928 Ha. The difference wrt the unperturbed situation is
#%%  0.000034725 microHa. With datasets 3 and 4, we are in the linear regime.
#%%  The previous amplitude is better for such studies.
#%%  Dataset 5 is the same as 3, with reversed amplitude. Results are similar to dataset 3.
#%%  I had no sufficient time to analyze these data correctly and make the connection with the
#%%  results of Tv2#05, unfortunately. The following (also test 02 below) gives some more data, and raise questions.
#%%  There might be some problem with the use of qprtrb and vprtrb.
#%%  For dataset 2, the group of the four lowest eigenenergies (each corresponding to a different molecule) is :
#%%  -0.47198  -0.46381  -0.46091  -0.45266 , whose spread is 0.01932 Ha.
#%%  One might think that the maximum and minimum of the potential are separated roughly by 0.02 Ha.
#%%  The value vprtrb 100 corresponds to a cosine wave whose amplitude is 100, divided by the volume
#%%  of the cell, that is 5000 Bohr^3 : 0.02 Ha. The maximum
#%%  and minimum of the potential should thus be separated by 0.04 Ha. There seems to be a factor of 2 off.
