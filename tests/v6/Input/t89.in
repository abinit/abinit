#%% description =
#%%   Computation of phonons frequencies for metallic occupations at q=0 0 0 within PAW
#%%   O2 (nsppol=1); this test is directly inspired by test v3#75.
#%%   In datasets 1-3, one computes the total energy and forces, without symmetries,
#%%   as it should be for accurate finite-difference tests.
#%%   From the reduced gradients with respect to displacements, one can deduce
#%%   a 2DTE of 149.9614 Ha.
#%%   In dataset 4, RF is computed with the Fermi energy correction,
#%%   and the agreement with finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3
#%%   is good : one gets 149.9612 Ha.
#%%   In dataset 5, RF is computed with frozen Fermi energy and the disagreement with
#%%   finite-differences of datasets 1 and 3 is large: one gets 124.9787 Ha.
