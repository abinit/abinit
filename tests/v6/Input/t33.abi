#%%   Test the mGGA implementation. Isolated Hydrogen atom. Two datasets are run.
#%%   One with a fake native mGGA (fake3, i.e. ixc 33) involving gradient of the density.
#%%   One with a fake native mGGA (fake4, i.e. ixc 34) involving kinetic energy density (and its gradient).
#%%   Both calculation should give the same total and exchange-correlation energies.
#%%   (Two other datasets are also run for spin polarized case)
