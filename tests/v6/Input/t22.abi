#%%   Hydrogen diatomic molecule in a cell, close to BCC.
#%%   One hydrogen atom is at the origin. The other lies initially
#%%   along the 1 1 1 direction, at a distance close to the one of the free dimer distance.
#%%   The final position is the mirror with respect to the plane perpendicular to x, passing at 1/2 0 0 .
#%%   The cell parameter is less than twice the H2 interatomic distance, so that the transition
#%%   path come close to the x axis, although it never reaches it (the closest being in the
#%%   mirror plane).
#%%   Test the images : 6 images, exploring the transition path by a simple algorithm.
#%%   MG: Does it work in parallel. I tried 2 CPUs and the run get stuck!
