#%%   NaCl molecule in a big box.
#%%   Test of the computation of the polarisation with the routine berryphase_new,
#%%   for different k-point grids : only 1 k-point, a line of k-points, and a full mesh of k-points.
#%%   Results with acell 20 10 10 are : -9.727 C/m^2, -9.975 C/m^2, -9.503 C/m^2
#%%   multiplied by the volume (in a.u.), gives -19454, -19950, -19006
