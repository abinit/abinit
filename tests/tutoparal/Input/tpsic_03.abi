#%% description =
#%%   NaI with a sligthly expanded lattice, to allow self-localisation of a hole polaron, using pSIC technique.
#%%   Realistic ecut and reasonable k point sampling, but small cell of only 8 atoms for testing.
#%%   The present test starts from a reasonable I-I interatomic distance, and search for the optimized polaron geometry, without constraint.
#%%
#%%   Parallelism until 12 procs is quite efficient. However, setting npband 2 does not bring noticeable improvement.
#%%   Although this is still subject for further investigation, the hypothesis is that the density/xc/potential part
#%%   is not improved with npband 2, while it is actually a major contribution, even with 32 bands.
#%%   Timing analysis is to be performed.
