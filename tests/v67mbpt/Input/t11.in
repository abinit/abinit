#%%   Silicon: Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) with norm-conserving pseudopotentials.
#%%   W is calculated at the RPA level while the scissors operator is used to open the gap by 0.8 eV.
#%%   First the BSE is solved with the direct diagonalization of the two-particle Hamiltonian, then
#%%   the Haydock iterative method is employed to calculate the macroscopic dielectric function.
#%%   The last dataset solves the BSE problem including the coupling between resonant and
#%%   anti-resonant transition via brute force diagonalization.
