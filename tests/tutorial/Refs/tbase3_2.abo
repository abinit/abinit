--- !BUG
src_file: m_kpts.F90
src_line: 1723
mpi_rank: 0
message: |
    The argument nkpt = 2, does not match
    the number of k points generated by kptopt, kptrlatt, shiftk,
    and the eventual symmetries, that is, nkpt= 10.
    However, note that it might be due to the user,
    if nkpt is explicitely defined in the input file.
    In this case, please check your input file.

  Action: contact ABINIT group (please attach the output of `abinit -b`)
