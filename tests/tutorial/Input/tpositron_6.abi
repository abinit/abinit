# Input for Positron tutorial
# Sixth step (part 1) of the tutorial on electron-positron annihilation
# Positron lifetime calculation within PAW - 12 valence electrons
# Si, 2 atoms in the box

# This input file is similar to tpositron_1.abi, except:
#   - the number of bands, because of the additional 8 electrons states

#Define the different datasets
ndtset 2          # 2 datasets

#FIRST DATASET
positron1  0      # Dataset 1 is a simple electronic GS calculation

#SECOND DATASET
positron2  1      # Dataset 2 is a positronic GS calculation
getden2    1      #   in presence of the previous electronic density

kptopt2    0      #   Use only k=gamma point

ixcpositron2 1    # We are using the Boronski and Nieminen parametrization

posocc2      1    # Occupation number for the positron
                  #  (should be set <1 for bulk calculation with a small cell).
                  # Here the zero positron density limit is used,
                  #   so results do not depend on posocc.
