#Definition of the unit cell

#Definition of the atom types

znucl 13          # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Aluminum

#Definition of the planewave basis set
ecut  6.0         # Maximal kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree

#Definition of the k-point grid
ngkpt 2 2 2       # This is a 2x2x2 FCC grid, based on the primitive vectors
nshiftk 4         # of the reciprocal space. For a FCC real space lattice,
                  # like the present one, it actually corresponds to the
                  # so-called 4x4x4 Monkhorst-Pack grid, if the following shifts
                  # are used :
shiftk 0.5 0.5 0.5

#Definition of the SCF procedure
