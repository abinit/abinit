#Definition of the k-point grid

# NOTE that the same grids (see ngkpt below) can be generated with only one shift, and a clever choice of the
# reciprocal space basis vectors, thanks to the use of ithe input variable kptrlatt instead of ngkpt. 
# Actually the echo of such input k point gris by ABINITT will indeed rely on only one shiftk vector, and the use of kptrlatt.
# Still, the input and output k point grids are entirely equivalent.
