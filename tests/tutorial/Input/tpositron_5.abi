positron   -10    # We perform automatic calculation of electrons and positron densities
                  #   in the two-component DFT context (storing wavefunctions in memory)
                  # Automatic electron-positron loop has to be switched on in Doppler calculations
                  #   to have both electron and positron wavefunctions in memory

posnstep     2    # Maximum number of electon and positron steps = 2
                  # We simulate a delocalized positron, so we only perform two steps
                  #   of electon-positron calculations. It means that the electronic
                  #   wavefunction is not affected by the positron.
                  
posdoppler   1    # Activation of Doppler broadening calculation

ixcpositron  1    # We are using the Boronski and Nieminen parametrization

posocc     1.0    # Occupation number for the positron
                  #   (should be set <1 for bulk calculation with a small cell).
                  # Here the zero positron density limit is used,
                  #   so results do not depend on posocc.

                  # Note about Brillouin zone sampling:
                  # In Doppler calculation we need to have a uniform k-point grid
                  #   in the momentum space. Symmetries are not used,
                  #   so the full grid needs to be specified.
