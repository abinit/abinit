# There are four datasets specified in this input:
# 1) Ground-state calculation to get the density.
# 2) NSCF run to generate the WFK file on a symmetric k-mesh (4x4x4, gamma-centered) 
# 3) NSCF run to generate another WFK file on a shifted 4x4x4 k-mesh that breaks the symmetry of the BZ sampling
# 4) SCR calculation with the WFK file generated in the second dataset
