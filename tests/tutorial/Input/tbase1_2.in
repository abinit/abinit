# This file to compute the total energy and forces as a function
# of the interatomic distance

#Define the different datasets
ndtset 21               # 21 datasets
xcart:  -0.5   0.0 0.0  # The starting values of the
         0.5   0.0 0.0  # atomic coordinates
xcart+  -0.025 0.0 0.0  # The increment of xcart from one dataset to the other
         0.025 0.0 0.0  #
getwfk  -1              # Will use the converged wavefunction from the
                        # previous dataset to start the new dataset computation
nband    1              # Only one band is occupied. In order to get the energy,
                        # there is no need to compute more than one band.

#The rest of this file is similar to the tbase1_1.in file, except
#that xcart has been moved above ...

#Definition of the unit cell
acell 10 10 10    # The keyword "acell" refers to the
                  # lengths of the primitive vectors (in Bohr)
#rprim 1 0 0  0 1 0  0 0 1 # This line, defining orthogonal primitive vectors,
                           # is commented, because it is precisely the default value of rprim

#Definition of the atom types and pseudopotentials
ntypat 1          # There is only one type of atom
znucl 1           # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the possible type(s) of atom.
                  # Here, the only type is Hydrogen. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned after the keyword "pseudos" should correspond to this type of atom.
pp_dirpath "$ABI_PSPDIR"                 # This is the path to the directory were pseudopotentials for tests are stored
pseudos "Pseudodojo_nc_sr_04_pw_standard_psp8/H.psp8"  # Name and location of the pseudopotential


#Definition of the atoms
natom 2           # There are two atoms
typat  1 1        # They both are of type 1, that is, Hydrogen

#Numerical parameters of the calculation : planewave basis set and k point grid

#Parameters for the SCF procedure
