# Computation of Density of States (DOS)

#Specific input parameters related to DOS printing

#Case 1: Total DOS
prtdos 1          # Flag to activate the total DOS output

#Case 2: projected DOS  (to be uncommented later)
#prtdos 3          # Flag to activate the projected DOS output
#pawprtdos 1       # Flag to activate the output of all PAW contributions
#natsph 1          # Number of atom(s) around which the projected DOS has to computed
#iatsph 1          #  Index of these atoms
#ratsph 1.51       #  Radius defining the projection area around the atom(s)

#For this calculation we take a metallic scheme for the occupation numbers
#This is mandatory for a DOS calculation
occopt 7           # Automatic generation of occupation numbers, as a metal
tsmear 0.005       # Smearing temperature for the metallic occupation scheme (Hartree)

#For this calculation we take more k-points to have a smoother DOS curve
ngkpt 10 10 10     # This is a 10x10x10 grid based on the primitive vectors
