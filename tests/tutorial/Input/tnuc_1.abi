# Computation of the electric field gradient at the atomic sites in stishovite
# Stishovite is a polymorph of SiO2 and has the rutile structure.

# Computation of EFG requires the use of PAW, Norm-conserving pseudopotentials are
# not appropriate for this calculation.

# here are the two variables needed to trigger computation of the field gradient
nucefg 2 # NUClear properties EFG, value of 2 means to also print its components
quadmom 0.0 -0.02558 # quadrupole moments of the nuclei (Si-29, O-17 here)
                     # so that couplings as measured in NMR or NQR are also
                     # reported, in MHz frequency units
                     
                     
#Definition of the unit cell
# stishovite has a primitive tetragonal cell, so two sides are equal,
# the third different, and the angles all 90 degrees
