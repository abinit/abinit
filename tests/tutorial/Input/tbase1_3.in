#The rest of this file is similar to the tbase1_1.in file, except
#that xcart has been moved above, and that toldfe has been replaced
#by toldff, see above.

#Definition of the unit cell
acell 10 10 10    # The keyword "acell" refers to the
                  # lengths of the primitive vectors (in Bohr)
#rprim 1 0 0  0 1 0  0 0 1 # This line, defining orthogonal primitive vectors,
                           # is commented, because it is precisely the default value of rprim

#Definition of the atom types and pseudopotentials
ntypat 1          # There is only one type of atom
znucl 1           # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the possible type(s) of atom.
                  # Here, the only type is Hydrogen. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned after the keyword "pseudos" should correspond to this type of atom.
pp_dirpath "$ABI_PSPDIR"                 # This is the path to the directory were pseudopotentials for tests are stored
pseudos "Pseudodojo_nc_sr_04_pw_standard_psp8/H.psp8"  # Name and location of the pseudopotential
                         

#Definition of the atoms
natom 2           # There are two atoms
typat 1 1         # They both are of type 1, that is, Hydrogen

#Numerical parameters of the calculation : planewave basis set and k point grid
ecut 10.0         # Maximal plane-wave kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree
kptopt 0          # Enter the k points manually
nkpt 1            # Only one k point is needed for isolated system,
                  # taken by default to be 0.0 0.0 0.0

#Parameters for the SCF procedure
nstep 10          # Maximal number of SCF cycles
#toldfe is no more defined, as toldff is used above... 
diemac 2.0        # Although this is not mandatory, it is worth to
                  # precondition the SCF cycle. The model dielectric
                  # function used as the standard preconditioner
                  # is described in the "dielng" input variable section.
                  # Here, we follow the prescriptions for molecules
