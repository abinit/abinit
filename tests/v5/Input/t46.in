#
# preliminary test for spin current calculation input variable prtspcur
# main contribution comes from Spin-Orbit terms of pseudopotential.
#
# This test is for a SC primitive cell of lead (Pb) with a HGH pseudopotential
#

# calculate then print out spin currents:
#   sigma_x along x, y, z
#   sigma_y along x, y, z
#   sigma_z along x, y, z
#
# for bulk systems, this should cancel, with no net current of any spin
