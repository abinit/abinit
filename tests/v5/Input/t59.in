#%%   Jellium thin slab with Wigner-Seitz radius=2.56 (~copper) + 1 Na adatom.
#%%   Computation of the total energy at the Na equilibrium distance from the
#%%   jellium edge and two other ones, slightly farther and slightly closer.
#%%   The total energies should indicate as more stable the equilibrium distance.
#%%   The number of k points has been much reduced
