#%%   Crystalline Silicon to test the CP2K pseudopotential implementation with
#%%   the new pseudo type: pspcod 10 (same formalism as HGH pseudopotentials, pspcod 3).
#%%   Same input file as t35.in of tests/tutorial, the only difference is that
#%%   in the test the used pseudo is taken from the CP2K library.
#%%   (http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cp2k/potentials/Goedecker/abinit/)
#%%   The bandstructure is in agreement with that calculated in the tutorial
#%%   example with the pspcod=1 pseudopotential.
