# silicon with PAW, creates both DEN and PAWDEN files.
# note that the DEN file is the standard, but includes
# only \tilde{n} and \hat{n}, needed for later PAW
# computations. The PAWDEN file is the correct PAW
# reconstructed density, and is useful for visualization
# and for AIM.

#%%   Generate both DEN and PAWDEN files for silicon. Note that in the PAW case, DEN files
#%%   include the valence density and compensation charge, while PAWDEN files include the
#%%   valence and on-site corrections, but not the compensation charge. Therefore, DEN files are
#%%   needed for further computations, while PAWDEN files are useful for visualization, AIM, and other
#%%   post-processing of the density.
