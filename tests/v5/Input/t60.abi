#Definition of the unit cell

#Definition of the atom types
ntypat 1          # There is only one type of atom
znucl 14          # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s)
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Silicon.


#Definition of the atoms
natom 2           # There are two atoms
typat 1 1         # They both are of type 1, that is, Silicon.
xred              # This keyword indicate that the location of the atoms
                  # will follow, one triplet of number for each atom
   0.0  0.0  0.0  # Triplet giving the REDUCED coordinate of atom 1.
   1/4  1/4  1/4  # Triplet giving the REDUCED coordinate of atom 2.
                  # Note the use of fractions (remember the limited
                  # interpreter capabilities of ABINIT)

#Definition of the planewave basis set
ecut  8.0         # Maximal kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree

#Definition of the k-point grid
ngkpt 2 2 2       # This is a 2x2x2 grid based on the primitive vectors
nshiftk 4         # of the reciprocal space (that form a BCC lattice !),
                  # repeated four times, with different shifts :

                  # In cartesian coordinates, this grid is simple cubic, and
                  # actually corresponds to the
                  # so-called 4x4x4 Monkhorst-Pack grid

#Definition of the SCF procedure
nstep 12          # Maximal number of SCF cycles or non-self-consistent optimisations
diemac 12.0       # Although this is not mandatory, it is worth to
                  # precondition the SCF cycle. The model dielectric
                  # function used as the standard preconditioner
                  # is described in the "dielng" input variable section.
                  # Here, we follow the prescription for bulk silicon.
