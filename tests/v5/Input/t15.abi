#%%   Test the use of the atvshift variable
#%%   First dataset : no shift, the ten states number 9 to 18
#%%   come from the 3d atomic states, the state number 19 is a bonding 4s state.
#%%   States number 16 and 17 are degenerate 3d pi antibonding states (m=1 and -1).
#%%   State number 18 is a 3d sigma antibonding state (m=0).
#%%   Second dataset : add a 0.001 atomic shift to the m=0 potential. Most of the
#%%   levels change by less than 0.0002 (and their energy decrease), except state number
#%%   9 (a 3d sigma bonding state (m=0)), that goes from -0.24020 to -0.23982 (+0.0004)
#%%   and state number 18, that goes from -0.15439 to 0.15399 (+0.0004).
#%%   Third dataset : add a 0.001 atomic shift to the m=1 and m=-1 potentials.
#%%   All the levels are affected (likely the m=1 and -1 orbitals adjust, and cause modification
#%%   of the potential), but the states 10, 11, 16, and 17 increase their energy, while the
#%%   other state see their energy decrease.
#%%   Acting separately on the m=1 potential or the m=-1 cause (correctly) the breaking
#%%   of the degeneracy.
#%%   This test was not easy to make portable. The problem lies in the fact that when the density
#%%   becomes negative, due to Bragg oscillations, the xc kernel can be extremely large, and when
#%%   use for the prediction of the residual of the forces, the differences between machines
#%%   can be extremely large. IN order to see this effect, put ecut 7 and npulayit 7 (its default value).
