#%%   Bulk jellium (the slab fills up the entire cell): computation of the total
#%%   energy. Tested 3 Wigner-Seitz radii: 1.5, 2 (~aluminum), 4. For each
#%%   Wigner-Seitz radius the energy per particle agrees with that analytically
#%%   calculated using the Teter-Pade functional form.
#%%   The number of k points has been much reduced, for the purpose of the automatic testing.
