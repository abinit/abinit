#%%   N2 molecule non-spin-polarized, but treated with nsppol=2, in a big box.
#%%   Similar to test 55 of tests/v3. There should be only
#%%   small numerical differences with respect to datasets 1 and 2 of this test,
#%%   due to the fact that the tetragonal symmetry was here slightly broken
#%%   for sake of portability of the automatic test.
#%%   Note however that the singlet and triplet states cannot be disentagled,
#%%   so one gets a big list of excitations, the merge of singlet and triplet
#%%   excitations.
