#%%   For the first two excitations, one finds :
#%%   2.40967E+00 eV , doubly degenerate  (Pi excitation)
#%%   3.94165E+00 eV  (Sigma+ excitation)
#%%   They come mainly from the 2nd occupied Kohn-Sham state, spin up.
#%%   The third excitation, at 5.11592E+00 eV (Sigma+ excitation) comes mainly from
#%%   the 1st occupied Kohn-Sham state, spin down.
#%%   Then, come excitations that are in the continuum, or close to it
#%%   (depending on the parameters of the calculation), so, harder to converge,
#%%   In order to have a calculation converged
#%%   at the level of 0.1 eV, one needs parameters like
#%%   nband 40 , ecut 10 , acell 30.
#%%   In that case, the three above-mentioned excitations become
#%%   2.388 eV (Pi), 4.432 eV (Sigma+), 5.357 eV (Sigma+).
#%%   In this case, the latter is no more the third excitation, as other ones,
#%%   coupled to the vacuum have a lower energy.
#%%   These numbers can be compared to the values given by
#%%   J. Guan, ME Casida, DR Salahub, J. of Mol. Structure - Theochem 527,
#%%   229, Sp. Iss. SI (2000) :
#%%   2.391 eV (1Pi), 4.593 eV (2Sigma+), 5.418 eV (5Sigma+),
#%%   and to the experimental values (see the above paper)
