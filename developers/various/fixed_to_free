# The purpose of this script is to translate fortran files
# that are written in fixed format to free format
# and move them in the directory  ..
# Usage :
# fixed_to_free file1 file2 ...
# Note : it uses the perl script FT77to90, that must be in the same 
# directory as fixed_to_free

# Count the number of files
set number_arg=$#argv
