#
# for all the following tests, use unix-style file paths
# they will be converted by function transpath if necessary
# file paths may contain a perl variable (e.g. $PSPS)
#
#   The following lines describe the tests to be run. The general syntax of 
# these lines is:	testID [command | program] parameters.
#
#   The first word is the test identification. All consecutive lines that begin
# with the same word will be executed in that order.
#   The second word specifies an ABINIT module or system command to be run. The
# following system commands are available: copy, erase
# The following keywords refer to ABINIT programs:
# 	abinis | seq	run the sequential version of abinis
#
#   parameters for copy and erase are file or directory names
#   parameters for the programs are either file paths derived from the
# subroutines 'doseqtest', ... in the old Run.pl scripts, or
# options to tailor the flow of results analysis and other operations before
# or after the tests;
# format for file paths is: fnI=path
# format for pseudo-potential file paths is: pspI=path
# format for the GEO file is: GEO=path
# format for options is: opt=option
# option can be either a standard option of the fldiff script (-easy , -medium),
# options to tailor the analysis of the results after test completion:
#	-nofld	don't run fldiff
#	-DOS	appply fdiff/ldiff to the o_DOS file
#	+xml	also apply diff/fldiff to the .cml file
# or the following options to modify the flow of operations during the test:
#	-keepfn4
# default options to call fldiff are: -ignore -ignoreP 
#
#   Default file names for the test with Id NNN (1 to 3 characters string):
# 1) abinis/seq
# fn1 = ../tNNN.in
# fn2 = tNNN.out
# fn3 =	tNNNi
# fn4 = tNNNo
# fn5 = tNNN
# fn6-fn9, psp1-psp4 = none
