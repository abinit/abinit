A test constists of an Abinit calculation producing the data files
    used by EPC, and a call to EPC which produces data in NetCDF format.

We use nosetests to run the test suite.
nosetests in a nutshell: If it looks like a test, it is executed.
                        

Follow these steps to create a new test:

1)
    Place the Abinit inputs, outputs, and  data files produced
    in a subdirectory of ElectronPhononCoupling/data/
    (including pseudopotentials).
    
    Create __init__.py file in this subdirectory,
    which defines the file names to be used.
    See for example ElectronPhononCoupling/data/LiF_g4/__init__.py
    
    Also place a reference directory containing the data file produced by EPC,
    for all the tests of this suite.

2)
    In the ElectronPhononCoupling/tests/ directory,
    create a python file whose name starts with 'test_'. 
    See for example ElectronPhononCoupling/tests/test_LiF_g4.py
    
    This file defines a test class with a series of tests
    to be run on this set of data.

3)
    If the new test is able to generate its reference data
    edit the file ElectronPhononCoupling/tests/generate.py 
    to add the generating function of the new test.

4)
    Edit the setup.py file to add the data files of the new test
    among the package data.
