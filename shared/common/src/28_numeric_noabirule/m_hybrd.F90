!c
!c     subroutine hybrd
!c
!c     the purpose of hybrd is to find a zero of a system of
!c     n nonlinear functions in n variables by a modification
!c     of the powell hybrid method. the user must provide a
!c     subroutine which calculates the functions. the jacobian is
!c     then calculated by a forward-difference approximation.
!c
!c     the subroutine statement is
!c
!c       subroutine hybrd(fcn,n,x,fvec,xtol,maxfev,ml,mu,epsfcn,
!c                        diag,mode,factor,nprint,info,nfev,fjac,
!c                        ldfjac,r,lr,qtf,wa1,wa2,wa3,wa4)
!c
!c     where
!c
!c       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
!c         calculates the functions. fcn must be declared
!c         in an external statement in the user calling
!c         program, and should be written as follows.
!c
!c         subroutine fcn(n,x,fvec,iflag)
!c         integer n,iflag
!c         double precision x(n),fvec(n)
!c         ----------
!c         calculate the functions at x and
!c         return this vector in fvec.
!c         ---------
!c         return
!c         end
!c
!c         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless
!c         the user wants to terminate execution of hybrd.
!c         in this case set iflag to a negative integer.
!c
!c       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
!c         of functions and variables.
!c
!c       x is an array of length n. on input x must contain
!c         an initial estimate of the solution vector. on output x
!c         contains the final estimate of the solution vector.
!c
!c       fvec is an output array of length n which contains
!c         the functions evaluated at the output x.
!c
!c       xtol is a nonnegative input variable. termination
!c         occurs when the relative error between two consecutive
!c         iterates is at most xtol.
!c
!c       maxfev is a positive integer input variable. termination
!c         occurs when the number of calls to fcn is at least maxfev
!c         by the end of an iteration.
!c
!c       ml is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
!c         the number of subdiagonals within the band of the
!c         jacobian matrix. if the jacobian is not banded, set
!c         ml to at least n - 1.
!c
!c       mu is a nonnegative integer input variable which specifies
!c         the number of superdiagonals within the band of the
!c         jacobian matrix. if the jacobian is not banded, set
!c         mu to at least n - 1.
!c
!c       epsfcn is an input variable used in determining a suitable
!c         step length for the forward-difference approximation. this
!c         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the
!c         functions are of the order of epsfcn. if epsfcn is less
!c         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative
!c         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
!c         precision.
!c
!c       diag is an array of length n. if mode = 1 (see
!c         below), diag is internally set. if mode = 2, diag
!c         must contain positive entries that serve as
!c         multiplicative scale factors for the variables.
!c
!c       mode is an integer input variable. if mode = 1, the
!c         variables will be scaled internally. if mode = 2,
!c         the scaling is specified by the input diag. other
!c         values of mode are equivalent to mode = 1.
!c
!c       factor is a positive input variable used in determining the
!c         initial step bound. this bound is set to the product of
!c         factor and the euclidean norm of diag*x if nonzero, or else
!c         to factor itself. in most cases factor should lie in the
!c         interval (.1,100.). 100. is a generally recommended value.
!c
!c       nprint is an integer input variable that enables controlled
!c         printing of iterates if it is positive. in this case,
!c         fcn is called with iflag = 0 at the beginning of the first
!c         iteration and every nprint iterations thereafter and
!c         immediately prior to return, with x and fvec available
!c         for printing. if nprint is not positive, no special calls
!c         of fcn with iflag = 0 are made.
!c
!c       info is an integer output variable. if the user has
!c         terminated execution, info is set to the (negative)
!c         value of iflag. see description of fcn. otherwise,
!c         info is set as follows.
!c
!c         info = 0   improper input parameters.
!c
!c         info = 1   relative error between two consecutive iterates
!c                    is at most xtol.
!c
!c         info = 2   number of calls to fcn has reached or exceeded
!c                    maxfev.
!c
!c         info = 3   xtol is too small. no further improvement in
!c                    the approximate solution x is possible.
!c
!c         info = 4   iteration is not making good progress, as
!c                    measured by the improvement from the last
!c                    five jacobian evaluations.
!c
!c         info = 5   iteration is not making good progress, as
!c                    measured by the improvement from the last
!c                    ten iterations.
!c
!c       nfev is an integer output variable set to the number of
!c         calls to fcn.
!c
!c       fjac is an output n by n array which contains the
!c         orthogonal matrix q produced by the qr factorization
!c         of the final approximate jacobian.
!c
!c       ldfjac is a positive integer input variable not less than n
!c         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac.
!c
!c       r is an output array of length lr which contains the
!c         upper triangular matrix produced by the qr factorization
!c         of the final approximate jacobian, stored rowwise.
!c
!c       lr is a positive integer input variable not less than
!c         (n*(n+1))/2.
!c
!c       qtf is an output array of length n which contains
!c         the vector (q transpose)*fvec.
!c
!c       wa1, wa2, wa3, and wa4 are work arrays of length n.

!c     given an n-vector x, this function calculates the

!c
!c     the euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of

!c     the definitions of small, intermediate and large components
!c     depend on two constants, rdwarf and rgiant. the main

!c           (s + u*v )*q
!c
!c     is again lower trapezoidal.

!c     which eliminate elements in the i-th and n-th planes,
!c     respectively. q itself is not accumulated, rather the
!c     information to recover the gv, gw rotations is returned.
