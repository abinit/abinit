!! NAME
!! defs_datatypes
!!
!! FUNCTION
!! This module contains definitions important structured datatypes for the ABINIT package.
!! If you want to add one new datatype, please, examine first whether
!! another datatype might meet your need (e.g. adding some records to it).
!! Then, if you are sure your new structured datatype is needed,
!! write it here, and DOCUMENT it properly (not all datastructure here are
!! well documented, it is a shame ...).
!! Do not forget: you will likely be the major winner if you document properly.
!! Proper documentation of a structured datatype means:
!!
!!  (1) Mention it in the list just below
!!  (2) Describe it in the NOTES section
!!  (3) Put it in alphabetical order in the the main section of this module
!!  (4) Document each of its records, except if they are described elsewhere
!!      (this exception is typically the case of the dataset associated with
!!      input variables, for which there is a help file)
!!
!! List of datatypes:
!! * ebands_t: different information about the band structure
!! * pseudopotential_type: for norm-conserving pseudopotential, all the information
!! * pspheader_type: for norm-conserving pseudopotentials, the header of the file

!!****t* defs_datatypes/ebands_t
!! NAME
!! ebands_t
!!
!! FUNCTION
!! It contains different information about the band structure: eigenenergies, residuals, derivative of occupation
!! numbers vs energy in case of metallic occupations and Brillouin zone according to the context: k points,
!! occupation numbers, storage mode of wavefunctions, weights ...
!! For example, the initial Brillouin zone, set up in the dataset, will be treated in the response function part of
!! the code, to give a reduced Brillouin zone different from the original one, due to the breaking of the symmetries
!! related to the existence of a wavevector, or the lack of time-reversal invariance.
