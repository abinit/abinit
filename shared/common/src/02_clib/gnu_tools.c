/* - Function: void mtrace (void)
 * When the mtrace function is called it looks for an environment variable named MALLOC_TRACE. 
 * This variable is supposed to contain a valid file name. The user must have write access. 
 * If the file already exists it is truncated. If the environment variable is not set or it does 
 * not name a valid file which can be opened for writing nothing is done. The behavior of malloc etc. is not changed. 
 * If the named file is successfully opened, mtrace installs special handlers for the functions malloc, realloc, and free 
 * (see Hooks for Malloc). From then on, all uses of these functions are traced and protocolled into the file. 
 * There is now of course a speed penalty for all calls to the traced functions so tracing should not be enabled during 
 * normal use. 
 * This function is a GNU extension and generally not available on other systems. The prototype can be found in mcheck.h.

/* - Function: void muntrace (void)
 * The muntrace function can be called after mtrace was used to enable tracing the malloc calls. 
 * If no (successful) call of mtrace was made muntrace does nothing. 
 * Otherwise it deinstalls the handlers for malloc, realloc, and free and then closes the protocol file. 
 * No calls are protocolled anymore and the program runs again at full speed. 
 * Please note that not only the application uses the traced functions, also libraries (including the C library itself) 
 * use these functions.
 * 
 * It is no good idea to call muntrace before the program terminated. The libraries are informed about 
 * the termination of the program only after the program returns from main or calls exit and so cannot 
 * free the memory they use before this time. 
 * 
 * So the best thing one can do is to call mtrace as the very first function in the program and never call muntrace. 
 * So the program traces almost all uses of the malloc functions (except those calls which are executed by 
 * constructors of the program or used libraries).
 * 
 * This function is a GNU extension and generally not available on other systems. The prototype can be found in mcheck.h.

 * It is too late to begin allocation checking once you have allocated anything with malloc.
