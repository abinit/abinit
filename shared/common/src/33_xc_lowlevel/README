Adding a new source file inside a directory "dirname"
=====================================================

In order to be treated properly by the ABINIT build system, 
a new source file should be declared in the file abinit.src
of the same directory (just one line to be added
per new file, rather self-explanatory).

Then, in order for the make to work :
(1) if the developer has the autotools working on his computer, he should 
 issue */*/makemake, then configure and make   
(2) otherwise, the developer should modify by hand the Makefile.am file 
 of the directory in which the file is placed (just one line to be added also), 
 then issue make.
