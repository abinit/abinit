!! 79_seqpar_mpi
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!! This directory contains level-8 routines that
!! have two versions, one sequential, and one MPI-parallel.
!! So, they must be handled in a special way.
!! The unique source present in this directory
!! for each routine, is preprocessed, and gives
!! two different binaries. These are gathered in two different
!! archive files.
