!! DESCRIPTION
!! This directory contains level-8 routines that
!! have two versions, one sequential, and one MPI-parallel.

!! The unique source present in this directory
!! for each routine, is preprocessed, and gives
!! two different binaries. These are gathered in two different
!! archive files.
