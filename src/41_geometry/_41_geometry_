!! DESCRIPTION
!! This directory contains level-2 routines that are related to the
!! treatment of the unit cell, the atomic positions inside
!! the unit cell (reduced coordinates or cartesian coordinates),
!! and the symmetry operations related
!! to the cell and atoms. In particular, the symmetry
!! recognition (symanal.F90, symspgr.F90),
!! the Bravais lattice recognition (symbrav.F90),
!! as well as the space group database (symgroup.F90)
!! can be found here.
