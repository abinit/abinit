!! 53_spacepar
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!! This directory contains level-2 routines used
!! to treat operations in reciprocal or real space that
!! need to be parallelized in this space.
!! These are mostly basic numerical routines, in the
!! spirit of BLAS, but adapted to wavefunctions or
!! density and potentials, in which one has to take
!! into account, on one side, the nspinor, isrtwfk, nspden
!! or cplex characteristics, and, on the other side,
!! the specific spread of the components in G- or R- space.
