Adding a new directory 
======================

Instructions can be adapted to move a directory inside src ( see point 4)
Do this only if you have the autotools...

0) create your directory, fill it, and add the infos in the bzr system

1) in config/specs/corelibs.conf , declare the new directory,
its attributes and its dependencies upon the external libraries

2) in config/specs/binaries.conf , specify the main codes that 
depends on the routines contained in this new directory

Then, in order for the make to work :
 issue */*/makemake, then configure and make

In case of a move, check that the doc (or other files) does not need any update.
Advice : find the occurrences thanks to 
grep name_of_directory * 
grep name_of_directory */*
