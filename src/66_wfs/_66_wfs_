!! NAME
!! 14wfs
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!! This directory contains level-4 routines used
!! to treat wavefunctions. The main entry points to
!! this library are the routines :
!! - getghc.F90 : apply the Hamiltonian to one wavefunction,
!!  use the routines in 53_ffts and 65_nonlocal
!! - projbd.F90 and orthon.F90 : project and orthonormalize
!!  the wavefunctions
!! - wfconv.F90 : convert one wavefunction with some
!!  parameters to another wavefunction with some other
!!  parameters (like PW sphere, spin or spinor characteristics
