# Config file for the support of linear algebra in Abinit
#
# Note: The following statements are in the Python "INI" format, with
#       case-sensitivity activated.
#
# Each of the following sections corresponds to a linear algebra component.
#
# Available options:
#
#   * depends  : dependencies on other architectural components (optional);
#   * detect   : detection method to use (mandatory);
#   * optional : whether the component is optional (mandatory);
#   * pullout  : where to retreat when detection yields nothing.

# WARNING: modify the defaults with *extreme* care!
