There seem to be no python-config executable on your system.
Python support will thus be very limited and you might not be
able to build ABINIT with all the desired options, unless you
configure all required PYTHON_*FLAGS manually.

One of the following commands may also resolve this issue:

  * sudo apt install python3-dev
  * sudo dnf install python-devel
