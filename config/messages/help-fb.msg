Your environment does not provide __mandatory libraries__,
but we can build them for you.

Please issue:

__cd fallbacks__
__./build-abinit-fallbacks.sh__

At the end of the process, the options needed to link
the external libraries will be proposed.

__copy/paste__ the options in your ac9 file and rerun configure.
