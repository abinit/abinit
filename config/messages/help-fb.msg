Your environment does not provide __mandatory libraries__, but we can build them for you. 
Please issue:

__cd fallbacks__
__./build-abinit-fallbacks.sh__

At the end of the process, the options needed to link
the external libraries will be proposed.

Just __copy/paste__ the options in your ac9 file and rerun configure.
