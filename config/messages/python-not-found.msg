Your system is missing a working Python interpreter.
This usually means that you need to first configure your
environment and/or install system packages.

Here are a few commands you can try:

  * module load Python
  * module load python
  * sudo apt install python-is-python3 python3-dev
  * sudo dnf install python3

After that, re-run the cofigure script of ABINIT.
