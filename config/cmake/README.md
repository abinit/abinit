CMake modules for autotools buildsystem
=======================================

This directory holds CMake modules designed to be used within ABINIT autotools buildsystem.
Using CMake within autotools was initially motivated for allowing the use of the Kokkos framework, which has complex
toolchain settings that are only handled through CMake modules of its own, thus making it a hard requirement in this case.
